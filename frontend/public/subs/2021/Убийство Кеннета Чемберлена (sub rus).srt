<i>Mr. Chamberlain, this is
Candace Wade of Lifeguard Medical Alerts.</i>

3
00:01:58,185 --> 00:01:59,821
<i>This line is being recorded.</i>

4
00:01:59,854 --> 00:02:02,155
<i>We just received an activation
from your pendant.</i>

5
00:02:02,189 --> 00:02:03,591
<i>Do you have an emergency?</i>

6
00:02:05,425 --> 00:02:08,428
<i>If you need us to send an
ambulance, I'll dispatch one now.</i>

7
00:02:09,363 --> 00:02:10,665
<i>Mr. Chamberlain?</i>

8
00:02:11,733 --> 00:02:14,301
<i>Hello?</i>

9
00:02:14,334 --> 00:02:16,504
<i>Okay, because I'm not getting
a response from you,</i>

10
00:02:16,537 --> 00:02:18,706
<i>I'm going to dispatch
emergency services now.</i>

11
00:02:18,740 --> 00:02:21,576
<i>Employee number 1674,
Candace Wade.</i>

12
00:03:03,951 --> 00:03:05,318
Jesus.

13
00:03:06,788 --> 00:03:08,255
What's the apartment number?

14
00:03:09,924 --> 00:03:13,861
87 to Dispatch, can we get the
apartment number on that well-check?

15
00:03:13,895 --> 00:03:16,931
<i>Copy, 87.
135, South Lexington, Apartment 2B.</i>

16
00:03:16,964 --> 00:03:19,967
<i>Subject's emotionally disturbed
and medically fragile.</i>

17
00:03:20,001 --> 00:03:23,403
Emotionally disturbed?
Can we get more info on that?

18
00:03:23,437 --> 00:03:26,841
<i>Negative.
Medical alert company just reported...</i>

19
00:03:26,874 --> 00:03:27,942
Copy that.

20
00:03:33,848 --> 00:03:36,450
Like a damn
third world country over here.

21
00:03:40,922 --> 00:03:43,758
2B, here we go.
Who wants to talk?

22
00:03:45,793 --> 00:03:47,028
I'll do it.

23
00:03:47,061 --> 00:03:48,361
Okay, good,

24
00:03:52,432 --> 00:03:53,735
Be assertive.

25
00:04:04,011 --> 00:04:05,980
White Plains Police.

26
00:04:06,013 --> 00:04:07,615
We're here for a welfare check.

27
00:04:12,887 --> 00:04:14,254
Okay.

28
00:04:23,030 --> 00:04:27,334
This is when they come.

29
00:04:41,716 --> 00:04:43,416
Can we help you?

30
00:04:55,395 --> 00:04:56,564
Hello?

31
00:04:56,597 --> 00:04:57,999
White Plains Police.

32
00:05:00,367 --> 00:05:02,069
I got nothing...

33
00:05:03,137 --> 00:05:04,639
for them.

34
00:05:08,543 --> 00:05:09,811
Welfare check.

35
00:05:20,755 --> 00:05:23,624
Hello?
White Plains Police.

36
00:05:23,658 --> 00:05:25,660
Welfare check.

37
00:05:32,499 --> 00:05:34,735
Hello. White Plains Police.

38
00:05:48,783 --> 00:05:49,851
Hello?

39
00:05:50,885 --> 00:05:52,485
What do you want?

40
00:05:52,520 --> 00:05:54,354
We're here for
a welfare check, sir.

41
00:05:54,989 --> 00:05:57,825
I'm not on welfare.

42
00:05:57,859 --> 00:06:01,863
Uh, our dispatch received a medical
alert call, possible emergency.

43
00:06:01,896 --> 00:06:04,464
We're here to help
any way we can, sir.

44
00:06:04,497 --> 00:06:06,767
I don't have no emergency.

45
00:06:08,603 --> 00:06:11,739
What, are you here to steal
my shoes again, are you?

46
00:06:16,077 --> 00:06:17,912
I'm gonna go back to sleep.

47
00:06:18,913 --> 00:06:20,648
Uh, hold on, sir.
Hold on, uh...

48
00:06:20,681 --> 00:06:22,550
Do you have anyone else
in your unit with you?

49
00:06:22,583 --> 00:06:23,651
Are you by yourself?

50
00:06:24,518 --> 00:06:26,587
Ain't no one else here.

51
00:06:26,621 --> 00:06:28,155
All right, well,
we got a call

52
00:06:28,189 --> 00:06:29,824
about a possible
medical emergency,

53
00:06:30,591 --> 00:06:31,726
And I'm telling you,

54
00:06:31,759 --> 00:06:34,795
I do not have an emergency.

55
00:06:34,829 --> 00:06:36,898
And I didn't call anybody.

56
00:06:37,765 --> 00:06:40,101
So, unless you

57
00:06:40,134 --> 00:06:43,037
planning on giving me
back my shoes,

58
00:06:43,070 --> 00:06:46,173
please leave me alone
and just let me go to sleep.

59
00:06:50,645 --> 00:06:54,916
Maybe get a confirmation
on the address?

60
00:06:54,949 --> 00:06:58,753
87 to Dispatch, could we have a confirmation
on the address for this well check?

61
00:06:59,820 --> 00:07:00,988
<i>Copy 87.</i>

62
00:07:01,022 --> 00:07:04,457
<i>Well check address, 1-3-5,
South Lexington, Unit 2B.</i>

63
00:07:08,529 --> 00:07:11,699
Sir, I'm not sure what to tell you.
We were sent to your address.

64
00:07:11,732 --> 00:07:15,970
This is, uh, 135, South
Lexington, Apartment 2B, correct?

65
00:07:16,871 --> 00:07:18,172
Yes.

66
00:07:18,205 --> 00:07:22,109
You don't have any medical
alert system that went off?

67
00:07:22,143 --> 00:07:25,112
Heart or blood pressure monitor?
Something like that?

68
00:07:51,572 --> 00:07:52,673
Hello?

69
00:08:04,685 --> 00:08:06,587
Everything's fine.

70
00:08:07,555 --> 00:08:09,757
You can all go home now.

71
00:08:09,790 --> 00:08:12,660
Nothing to see here.

72
00:08:18,833 --> 00:08:19,900
Hello?

73
00:08:22,003 --> 00:08:23,904
No emergency.

74
00:08:23,938 --> 00:08:25,806
It was an accident.

75
00:08:25,840 --> 00:08:27,274
Thank you for your trouble.

76
00:08:27,308 --> 00:08:29,276
We've got to
check you out, my friend.

77
00:08:29,310 --> 00:08:31,045
Make sure everything's okay.

78
00:08:31,078 --> 00:08:31,946
No, no, I'm fine.

79
00:08:31,979 --> 00:08:34,982
Uh, I don't need
nobody checking me out.

80
00:08:35,016 --> 00:08:36,951
It's 5:00 in the morning.

81
00:08:38,352 --> 00:08:40,955
87 to Command,
I'm on that well-check

82
00:08:40,988 --> 00:08:43,124
at 135, South Lexington...

83
00:08:43,157 --> 00:08:45,226
Subject is telling us
there is no emergency,

84
00:08:45,259 --> 00:08:47,595
that the medical alert
was a mistake.

85
00:08:47,628 --> 00:08:49,964
Please advise.

86
00:08:49,997 --> 00:08:52,867
<i>Just try
to make visual contact, 87.</i>

87
00:08:52,900 --> 00:08:55,269
Okay, copy.

88
00:08:55,302 --> 00:08:58,105
Let us check you out
and we'll leave you alone, sir.

89
00:08:59,206 --> 00:09:01,008
Be out of your hair
in five minutes.

90
00:09:01,042 --> 00:09:03,077
Uh... No, thank you.

91
00:09:03,110 --> 00:09:05,279
You can leave now.

92
00:09:05,312 --> 00:09:07,248
Can we, uh...

93
00:09:07,281 --> 00:09:10,084
Can you get a name? How about your name?
What's your name?

94
00:09:10,117 --> 00:09:11,685
Why do you need to know my name?

95
00:09:11,719 --> 00:09:15,256
So you can come in here and steal my
shoes again like you did the last time?

96
00:09:15,289 --> 00:09:18,292
The hell's he talking about
with these "shoes"?

97
00:09:18,325 --> 00:09:22,763
VZDP. Shoes could be
polka dot unicorns.

98
00:09:22,797 --> 00:09:25,699
We-we just need to put something
on the report, sir.

99
00:09:25,733 --> 00:09:28,369
Look, we didn't come here
because you're in trouble.

100
00:09:28,402 --> 00:09:31,305
We came here to help you
any way we can.

101
00:09:31,338 --> 00:09:34,675
The more you cooperate with
us, the sooner we can get out of here.

102
00:09:39,080 --> 00:09:40,081
Kenneth.

103
00:09:41,315 --> 00:09:42,817
I'm sorry. One more time.

104
00:09:43,684 --> 00:09:45,052
Kenneth.

105
00:09:45,086 --> 00:09:47,021
Last name?

106
00:09:47,054 --> 00:09:48,289
Chamberlain.

107
00:09:50,191 --> 00:09:52,159
Thank you, Mr. Chamberlain.

108
00:09:52,193 --> 00:09:54,361
Is there anyone else
in the apartment with you?

109
00:09:54,395 --> 00:09:57,331
No! I told you it's just me.

110
00:09:57,364 --> 00:09:59,967
All right, well, ahem,
can you, uh...

111
00:10:00,000 --> 00:10:01,769
Can you open the door for us?

112
00:10:01,802 --> 00:10:03,971
We need to check you out.
It's for your own good.

113
00:10:04,004 --> 00:10:06,340
I'm not gonna open my door.

114
00:10:06,373 --> 00:10:08,142
Now, I-I don't need you.

115
00:10:08,609 --> 00:10:10,144
It was a mistake.

116
00:10:10,177 --> 00:10:12,379
I did not call you.

117
00:10:12,413 --> 00:10:15,649
Hey, Mr. Chamberlain,
are you getting in any trouble?

118
00:10:15,683 --> 00:10:17,351
Are you doing anything illegal
in your home?

119
00:10:17,384 --> 00:10:20,354
What? No, I'm not doing
anything illegal.

120
00:10:20,387 --> 00:10:22,089
What do you asking me that for?

121
00:10:22,123 --> 00:10:23,657
Because we're trying
to understand.

122
00:10:23,691 --> 00:10:25,893
No, It's 5:00 in the morning.

123
00:10:26,460 --> 00:10:28,829
I'm 70 years old.

124
00:10:30,164 --> 00:10:32,299
I got a bad heart

125
00:10:32,333 --> 00:10:34,301
and I want to go to sleep.

126
00:10:34,335 --> 00:10:35,202
That's fine.

127
00:10:35,236 --> 00:10:37,805
Then you have nothing
to worry about.

128
00:10:37,838 --> 00:10:39,907
But you won't open
the door for us, sir?

129
00:10:42,409 --> 00:10:43,911
I think

130
00:10:43,944 --> 00:10:45,379
it's time to go.

131
00:10:47,081 --> 00:10:48,782
It's time to go.

132
00:10:50,451 --> 00:10:51,852
Hello?

133
00:10:54,155 --> 00:10:56,257
Mr. Chamberlain. Hello?

134
00:11:06,901 --> 00:11:08,302
Hello?

135
00:11:13,307 --> 00:11:16,277
<i>Lifeguard, this is Candace.
Do you have an emergency?</i>

136
00:11:16,310 --> 00:11:18,179
Police are at my door.

137
00:11:19,246 --> 00:11:21,148
And the police are outside

138
00:11:21,849 --> 00:11:23,384
for no reason.

139
00:11:23,417 --> 00:11:26,887
<i>Sir, for confirmation
purposes, can you give me your name?</i>

140
00:11:27,388 --> 00:11:29,456
Kenneth Chamberlain.

141
00:11:29,490 --> 00:11:30,858
<i>All right, Mr. Chamberlain,</i>

142
00:11:30,891 --> 00:11:34,328
<i>I see that you activated your
pendant at 5:22 this morning.</i>

143
00:11:34,361 --> 00:11:36,463
<i>Are you okay?
Do you have an emergency?</i>

144
00:11:36,497 --> 00:11:38,766
No, I did not have an emergency!

145
00:11:38,799 --> 00:11:40,367
I... I'm fine.

146
00:11:40,401 --> 00:11:43,771
<i>Okay, well, the reason the police are
there is because whenever a patient</i>

147
00:11:43,804 --> 00:11:45,105
<i>activates their alert system</i>

148
00:11:45,139 --> 00:11:46,575
<i>and we can't get
in touch with them,</i>

149
00:11:46,608 --> 00:11:50,311
<i>we immediately dispatch emergency
services to check on the person.</i>

150
00:11:50,344 --> 00:11:53,214
Yes, yes.

151
00:11:53,247 --> 00:11:55,015
But I did not call them,

152
00:11:55,049 --> 00:11:56,984
and I want them to go.

153
00:11:57,017 --> 00:12:00,221
<i>Okay, Mr. Chamberlain, I...</i>

154
00:12:00,254 --> 00:12:02,256
<i>Yes, I'm sorry. Go ahead.</i>

155
00:12:02,823 --> 00:12:05,926
Somebody...

156
00:12:07,461 --> 00:12:09,463
Somebody's been

157
00:12:09,496 --> 00:12:12,299
breaking into my apartment

158
00:12:12,333 --> 00:12:14,935
and stealing my stuff!

159
00:12:15,869 --> 00:12:17,137
And the...

160
00:12:17,171 --> 00:12:19,840
And the police, they won't...

161
00:12:19,873 --> 00:12:22,910
<i>Mr. Chamberlain, I have
your service history pulled up here.</i>

162
00:12:22,943 --> 00:12:25,045
<i>I see that you're on
our psychiatric watchlist.</i>

163
00:12:25,079 --> 00:12:27,414
<i>Have you been experiencing
any increased symptoms,</i>

164
00:12:27,448 --> 00:12:29,783
<i>anxiety, anything like that?</i>

165
00:12:29,817 --> 00:12:32,353
<i>What I'm saying is that I'm sure
the police are there to help.</i>

166
00:12:36,090 --> 00:12:37,091
It...

167
00:12:37,592 --> 00:12:39,927
It was an accident.

168
00:12:40,595 --> 00:12:43,297
I didn't activate nothing.

169
00:12:43,330 --> 00:12:46,033
I don't need any help.

170
00:12:46,066 --> 00:12:48,269
CANDACE <i>Okay. So,</i>
<i>you don't have an emergency?</i>

171
00:12:48,302 --> 00:12:52,039
No, I'm fine.

172
00:12:53,841 --> 00:12:56,877
I want the police to leave.

173
00:12:58,613 --> 00:13:00,481
What do you think?

174
00:13:00,515 --> 00:13:02,883
Blue bell lab in the kitchen?

175
00:13:02,916 --> 00:13:04,285
That's why
he won't open the door?

176
00:13:08,222 --> 00:13:09,857
Mr. Chamberlain,

177
00:13:10,525 --> 00:13:12,026
are you there?

178
00:13:13,994 --> 00:13:15,929
They're still
knocking at my door.

179
00:13:15,963 --> 00:13:17,331
Hello?

180
00:13:17,364 --> 00:13:18,899
I'm telling you,

181
00:13:18,932 --> 00:13:22,069
they're here
'cause they want to hurt me.

182
00:13:22,102 --> 00:13:24,506
<i>That's our standard procedure...</i>

183
00:13:24,539 --> 00:13:27,274
<i>...if we're unable to reach you
via the call box or by phone.</i>

184
00:13:27,308 --> 00:13:29,243
<i>We always dispatch
emergency services.</i>

185
00:13:29,276 --> 00:13:31,312
<i>And that includes
police officers.</i>

186
00:13:31,345 --> 00:13:33,947
<i>I see you have your sister
listed here as a reference.</i>

187
00:13:33,981 --> 00:13:35,349
<i>Would you like us to call her?</i>

188
00:13:36,651 --> 00:13:38,285
Yes.

189
00:13:38,319 --> 00:13:39,920
<i>All right, I'm gonna call her,</i>

190
00:13:39,953 --> 00:13:42,956
<i>and then reach back out
to you on your call box.</i>

191
00:13:44,358 --> 00:13:45,593
Okay.

192
00:13:55,469 --> 00:13:56,937
Mr. Chamberlain.

193
00:13:58,105 --> 00:14:00,240
We need to make sure
you're okay, sir.

194
00:14:03,177 --> 00:14:04,078
He's not there.

195
00:14:04,111 --> 00:14:06,347
What did he do,
jump out the damn window?

196
00:14:10,585 --> 00:14:13,253
Look, I'm telling you

197
00:14:13,287 --> 00:14:16,390
the alarm was a mistake.

198
00:14:16,423 --> 00:14:18,325
I'm not sick.

199
00:14:18,359 --> 00:14:21,362
Do you have any serious
medical conditions, sir?

200
00:14:21,395 --> 00:14:23,063
What the he...

201
00:14:23,097 --> 00:14:27,234
So, now you're asking me
about my medical history?

202
00:14:27,267 --> 00:14:30,304
I told you I have a bad heart.

203
00:14:30,337 --> 00:14:32,106
We're just trying
to help you out, sir.

204
00:14:32,139 --> 00:14:34,341
I don't know
how many different ways

205
00:14:34,375 --> 00:14:38,479
I can tell you this,
but I do not need your help!

206
00:14:38,513 --> 00:14:40,481
- Mr. Chamberlain, we just...
- Leave!

207
00:14:40,515 --> 00:14:41,516
Leave!

208
00:15:01,268 --> 00:15:02,637
Excuse me.

209
00:15:02,670 --> 00:15:04,438
I'm Kenny's niece.

210
00:15:04,471 --> 00:15:06,674
My mama said
he's having a problem.

211
00:15:17,050 --> 00:15:18,085
Can I help you?

212
00:15:18,118 --> 00:15:19,953
Yeah, I'm Kenny's niece.

213
00:15:19,987 --> 00:15:21,989
That's his apartment
you're banging on.

214
00:15:22,022 --> 00:15:23,390
Did he do something?

215
00:15:25,693 --> 00:15:27,261
That's what we're trying
to find out.

216
00:15:27,294 --> 00:15:28,962
You know, he has
a heart condition

217
00:15:28,996 --> 00:15:31,031
and sometimes he...

218
00:15:31,064 --> 00:15:32,433
Sometimes he doesn't
think right.

219
00:15:32,466 --> 00:15:34,968
You know, he imagines things.

220
00:15:35,002 --> 00:15:37,605
Does he have any weapons
in his apartment?

221
00:15:37,639 --> 00:15:39,541
I don't know. I...
I don't think so.

222
00:15:39,574 --> 00:15:41,308
Anyone else in there with him?

223
00:15:41,341 --> 00:15:42,276
I doubt it.

224
00:15:42,309 --> 00:15:44,178
You could talk to my mama.
She might be...

225
00:15:44,211 --> 00:15:45,613
No, thank you, ma'am.

226
00:15:45,647 --> 00:15:48,449
- You don't wanna talk to...
- Thank you for the help.

227
00:15:49,416 --> 00:15:50,951
We'll handle it from here.

228
00:16:06,433 --> 00:16:08,035
Hello?

229
00:16:08,068 --> 00:16:09,470
<i>Kenny, it's Carol.</i>

230
00:16:09,504 --> 00:16:10,437
<i>What's happening?</i>

231
00:16:10,471 --> 00:16:12,607
<i>I got a call
from your medical company.</i>

232
00:16:12,640 --> 00:16:15,375
<i>They said the police are outside your door.</i>

233
00:16:15,409 --> 00:16:17,712
Yeah. Yeah.

234
00:16:17,745 --> 00:16:19,681
Look, i-it was an accident.

235
00:16:19,714 --> 00:16:22,550
I set off my alarm.

236
00:16:22,584 --> 00:16:24,184
<i>So you're fine?</i>

237
00:16:24,218 --> 00:16:25,653
<i>No medical problems?</i>

238
00:16:26,487 --> 00:16:28,656
No, I'm all right.

239
00:16:28,690 --> 00:16:31,391
<i>Well, I called Tonyia.
She'll speak to them.</i>

240
00:16:31,425 --> 00:16:33,595
No. No. No, Carol.

241
00:16:33,628 --> 00:16:35,563
<i>Why not?</i>

242
00:16:35,597 --> 00:16:37,765
You know how to police
are around here.

243
00:16:37,799 --> 00:16:40,668
Yeah. I don't want her
getting hurt or nothing.

244
00:16:40,702 --> 00:16:42,604
<i>I just told her
what's going on.</i>

245
00:16:42,637 --> 00:16:44,539
<i>Let her decide
what she wants to do.</i>

246
00:16:44,572 --> 00:16:47,374
<i>Call me when they leave, okay?</i>

247
00:16:47,407 --> 00:16:48,510
All right.

248
00:17:01,388 --> 00:17:03,390
Get his ID. Let's run it.

249
00:17:04,692 --> 00:17:06,393
Maybe he's got a warrant out.

250
00:17:15,335 --> 00:17:17,337
Mr. Chamberlain,
we have an obligation

251
00:17:17,371 --> 00:17:18,740
to make sure that you're safe

252
00:17:18,773 --> 00:17:21,843
and anyone else
in your apartment is all right.

253
00:17:21,876 --> 00:17:24,144
What do you say
we start with an ID, huh?

254
00:17:25,245 --> 00:17:27,247
Can you show us
some identification?

255
00:17:29,249 --> 00:17:32,119
- Mr. Chamberlain...
- I'm not opening my door.

256
00:17:32,152 --> 00:17:34,254
You can hear that I'm okay.

257
00:17:34,288 --> 00:17:36,858
Why do you need to come
into my apartment?

258
00:17:38,026 --> 00:17:40,762
- What does he think's gonna happen, man...
- Shh!

259
00:17:47,669 --> 00:17:48,736
When they're here,

260
00:17:48,770 --> 00:17:51,104
when they stop
trying to get me.

261
00:17:51,138 --> 00:17:52,774
I think someone else
is in there with him.

262
00:17:57,879 --> 00:18:00,314
Mr. Chamberlain, why don't you
pass on over your ID?

263
00:18:00,347 --> 00:18:01,716
Just slip it
underneath the door.

264
00:18:01,749 --> 00:18:03,450
Push it through,
and we'll pick it up.

265
00:18:13,193 --> 00:18:14,729
Put 'em on lockdown.

266
00:18:16,263 --> 00:18:18,432
Shit.

267
00:18:19,567 --> 00:18:22,302
Put them on lockdown.

268
00:18:22,336 --> 00:18:23,571
Where is it?

269
00:18:26,941 --> 00:18:29,510
Here.

270
00:18:32,279 --> 00:18:33,881
Solitary.

271
00:18:33,915 --> 00:18:35,349
Solitary.

272
00:19:02,309 --> 00:19:04,144
Huh. Fucker was in the Marines.

273
00:19:04,612 --> 00:19:05,813
Oorah.

274
00:19:07,548 --> 00:19:09,282
Here, run it.

275
00:19:09,316 --> 00:19:13,220
87 to Dispatch,
we have VA ID for the resident here.

276
00:19:14,689 --> 00:19:16,323
<i>Copy, 87.</i>

277
00:19:16,958 --> 00:19:18,225
Marine Corps ID

278
00:19:18,258 --> 00:19:21,896
"Alpha-Roger-1-6-4-6-7-8-3-0."

279
00:19:28,402 --> 00:19:30,538
<i>Mr. Chamberlain,
we spoke to your sister</i>

280
00:19:30,571 --> 00:19:32,305
<i>and she's aware
of what's happening.</i>

281
00:19:34,776 --> 00:19:36,644
<i>Mr... Mr. Chamberlain,
are you there?</i>

282
00:19:38,613 --> 00:19:40,915
<i>Hi, sir, can you hear me?</i>

283
00:19:43,851 --> 00:19:45,252
<i>Hello?</i>

284
00:19:46,621 --> 00:19:50,390
The... The police
is still outside my door.

285
00:19:51,526 --> 00:19:53,061
They got my ID now.

286
00:19:53,094 --> 00:19:56,664
<i>Mr. Chamberlain, do you want
me to call and cancel the dispatch?</i>

287
00:19:56,698 --> 00:19:57,699
Yes.

288
00:19:59,901 --> 00:20:03,671
<i>ID confirmed.
Victim's disturbed, but no priors.</i>

289
00:20:03,705 --> 00:20:06,406
<i>Received treatment
for substance abuse in 99',</i>

290
00:20:06,440 --> 00:20:08,576
<i>and involuntary psych hold
in 05'.</i>

291
00:20:11,012 --> 00:20:12,880
See if he's got a diagnosis.

292
00:20:12,914 --> 00:20:15,282
Uh, this is 87.

293
00:20:15,315 --> 00:20:18,218
Do we have, uh, diagnosis
on the subject at South Lex?

294
00:20:20,487 --> 00:20:23,423
<i>Alert company said
bipolar with psychotic features.</i>

295
00:20:27,862 --> 00:20:30,832
If he's emotionally disturbed,
we shouldn't be banging on the door.

296
00:20:30,865 --> 00:20:33,333
I mean, it's just gonna
get him more upset.

297
00:20:33,366 --> 00:20:34,736
What difference does that make?

298
00:20:36,504 --> 00:20:38,005
If he's EDP,

299
00:20:38,039 --> 00:20:40,273
We just need to
wait him out, right?

300
00:20:40,307 --> 00:20:42,810
What'd you do
before this Rossi?

301
00:20:44,478 --> 00:20:46,013
What do you mean?

302
00:20:46,047 --> 00:20:47,515
Your job, what'd you do?

303
00:20:50,752 --> 00:20:52,452
I was
a middle school teacher, why?

304
00:20:54,021 --> 00:20:55,422
No reason.

305
00:21:22,784 --> 00:21:24,351
I gotta go.

306
00:21:24,952 --> 00:21:26,554
I gotta go.

307
00:21:34,729 --> 00:21:35,730
Hmm...

308
00:21:44,939 --> 00:21:46,174
Hello?

309
00:21:46,207 --> 00:21:49,376
<i>Daddy, what's going on?
Aunt Carol called me.</i>

310
00:21:49,409 --> 00:21:52,980
Oh! hey, baby!
Everything is fine.

311
00:21:53,014 --> 00:21:57,484
Uh, what did Carol
tell you exactly?

312
00:21:57,518 --> 00:22:00,655
<i>She told me your alert went off and
the police have entered our apartment.</i>

313
00:22:00,688 --> 00:22:02,023
<i>Are you okay?</i>

314
00:22:02,056 --> 00:22:04,859
I'm fine. It's a...

315
00:22:04,892 --> 00:22:08,629
It's just that damn
alert system.

316
00:22:10,497 --> 00:22:12,099
<i>Is that officer there?</i>

317
00:22:12,133 --> 00:22:14,467
<i>Your work from a few years ago?</i>

318
00:22:14,502 --> 00:22:15,970
<i>Get on the ground.</i>

319
00:22:16,003 --> 00:22:17,972
<i>Don't think about it!</i>

320
00:22:18,005 --> 00:22:21,075
<i>Daddy?
Daddy, you there?</i>

321
00:22:21,108 --> 00:22:25,378
No, no, no. No, he's not.

322
00:22:25,947 --> 00:22:27,447
Don't worry. It's okay.

323
00:22:28,983 --> 00:22:31,118
<i>Alright. Oh,
Ava wants to say, hi.</i>

324
00:22:31,152 --> 00:22:32,485
<i>Pa-pa! Pa-pa!</i>

325
00:22:32,520 --> 00:22:34,956
Oh, well... Hey, goochi!

326
00:22:34,989 --> 00:22:38,526
Peekaboo! Grandpa here.

327
00:22:38,559 --> 00:22:40,427
Uh!

328
00:22:40,460 --> 00:22:45,432
Look, give doodlebug
a big kiss for me.

329
00:22:45,465 --> 00:22:48,569
But the police
are outside and, uh,

330
00:22:49,570 --> 00:22:51,606
I got to go talk to them.

331
00:22:52,940 --> 00:22:54,642
I'll call you when they leave.

332
00:22:55,610 --> 00:22:58,411
- <i>Okay. Love you dad.</i>
- I love you too.

333
00:23:04,051 --> 00:23:06,687
They gotta go,
they gotta go.

334
00:23:07,722 --> 00:23:10,758
Yes, sir, may I break ranks?

335
00:23:10,791 --> 00:23:13,460
No, you may not, Marine...

336
00:23:17,698 --> 00:23:19,901
One, two, three, it's ready.

337
00:23:23,137 --> 00:23:26,741
We've done everything
we can. He said he's fine.

338
00:23:26,774 --> 00:23:29,510
Special circumstances.
Couldn't we put that in the report?

339
00:23:29,543 --> 00:23:31,779
It's a liability.
We need to make visual contact.

340
00:23:33,547 --> 00:23:35,850
Besides, there's something
going on in there.

341
00:23:35,883 --> 00:23:37,484
Listen, he's talking to someone.

342
00:23:40,121 --> 00:23:43,624
Look, I know
you're new to this.

343
00:23:43,658 --> 00:23:46,227
But you've lived here,
you know what goes on on the South side.

344
00:23:46,260 --> 00:23:47,862
Yeah. I'm with Sarge.

345
00:23:47,895 --> 00:23:50,531
You can practically smell it,
coming through the walls.

346
00:23:50,564 --> 00:23:52,600
Ross, if you want
to risk it, feel free.

347
00:23:52,633 --> 00:23:54,602
But think about
what you're hearing in there.

348
00:23:54,635 --> 00:23:56,771
If you leave here,
and he's got some hooker

349
00:23:56,804 --> 00:23:59,073
tied up in the closet,
or he dies of a heart attack,

350
00:23:59,106 --> 00:24:02,109
you could have a hurricane
of shit raining down on you.

351
00:24:02,143 --> 00:24:05,880
I'm just saying we shouldn't be
banging on doors

352
00:24:05,913 --> 00:24:09,116
and yelling and screaming
at emotionally disturbed people.

353
00:24:09,150 --> 00:24:13,054
Okay, so what do you suggest
that we do, teach?

354
00:24:14,188 --> 00:24:16,489
And leaving isn't an option.

355
00:24:16,524 --> 00:24:19,760
I say we wait him out.
We would be patient, you know?

356
00:24:19,794 --> 00:24:23,130
- I mean, the manual says that...
- Whoa! What! Whoa!

357
00:24:23,164 --> 00:24:25,232
Don't throw the manual
in my face, okay.

358
00:24:25,266 --> 00:24:26,801
It's the real world.

359
00:24:26,834 --> 00:24:28,669
Not you're fucking
fifth grade classroom.

360
00:24:29,503 --> 00:24:31,272
Let me give you
a piece of advice.

361
00:24:31,305 --> 00:24:33,607
If you ever speak that way
around a Lieutenant,

362
00:24:33,641 --> 00:24:36,844
they're gonna stick your ass in a desk
before you can take your next breath.

363
00:24:41,182 --> 00:24:42,583
I will talk to him.

364
00:24:43,684 --> 00:24:45,019
Okay? We're not gonna hurt him.

365
00:24:45,052 --> 00:24:47,188
Just gonna make sure
he's not hurting anyone else.

366
00:24:54,161 --> 00:24:56,197
Mr. Chamberlain,
let me tell you exactly

367
00:24:56,230 --> 00:24:58,199
what's gonna happen
when you open this door.

368
00:24:58,232 --> 00:25:00,668
We're gonna come in,
we're gonna check you out.

369
00:25:00,701 --> 00:25:01,836
We're gonna make sure

370
00:25:01,869 --> 00:25:04,605
that you're not
in a physical distress.

371
00:25:04,638 --> 00:25:08,209
Gonna make sure that there's nothing strange
going on. And then we're gonna leave.

372
00:25:08,242 --> 00:25:12,079
If everything checks out, we'll be out
of your hair in five minutes, tops.

373
00:25:12,113 --> 00:25:13,614
Then you can go back to bed.

374
00:25:19,053 --> 00:25:20,621
Mr. Chamberlain?

375
00:25:24,258 --> 00:25:25,693
Mr. Chamberlain?

376
00:25:29,296 --> 00:25:31,732
Open the door right now.

377
00:25:35,102 --> 00:25:37,171
Open this fucking door.

378
00:26:14,141 --> 00:26:15,209
Hello?

379
00:26:15,242 --> 00:26:17,178
- <i>Mr. Chamberlain?</i>
- Yes.

380
00:26:17,211 --> 00:26:18,846
<i>I reached out
to the department.</i>

381
00:26:18,879 --> 00:26:20,681
<i>I did my best
to cancel the dispatch,</i>

382
00:26:20,714 --> 00:26:24,852
<i>but they said they may need to make the entry,
anyway. Are the officers still there?</i>

383
00:26:24,885 --> 00:26:26,921
Make... Entry...

384
00:26:28,155 --> 00:26:30,191
Into my apartment?

385
00:26:30,224 --> 00:26:33,094
- <i>Yes, sir. But it's just to...</i>
- No.

386
00:26:33,127 --> 00:26:34,328
<i>To make sure...</i>

387
00:26:34,361 --> 00:26:37,765
They cannot come
into my apartment.

388
00:26:41,168 --> 00:26:42,269
Alright.

389
00:26:47,942 --> 00:26:49,276
Piece of shit!

390
00:26:49,910 --> 00:26:50,945
<i>Mr. Chamberlain?</i>

391
00:26:50,978 --> 00:26:53,414
<i>They're only there
to make sure you're okay.</i>

392
00:26:53,447 --> 00:26:56,350
<i>Sir, you sound like you're
suffering from some paranoia.</i>

393
00:26:56,383 --> 00:26:58,752
<i>Possibly other
increased symptoms.</i>

394
00:26:58,786 --> 00:27:01,322
<i>Have you been taking
your medication routinely?</i>

395
00:27:01,355 --> 00:27:03,657
Yes.

396
00:27:03,691 --> 00:27:06,894
I have been taking
my medications.

397
00:27:06,927 --> 00:27:08,028
<i>Okay, sir.</i>

398
00:27:08,062 --> 00:27:10,364
<i>Did something happen
with the police in the past?</i>

399
00:27:10,397 --> 00:27:13,801
<i>Is there a specific reason you
don't want to open the door?</i>

400
00:27:31,051 --> 00:27:32,286
<i>Can you talk to them?</i>

401
00:27:32,319 --> 00:27:34,822
<i>Explain to them that the
dispatch has been cancelled</i>

402
00:27:34,855 --> 00:27:37,191
a <i>nd ask them politely</i>
<i>to leave?</i>

403
00:27:42,296 --> 00:27:43,330
Excuse me.

404
00:27:45,399 --> 00:27:46,934
Excuse me.

405
00:27:46,967 --> 00:27:48,435
Hey, wait,
wait, wait. Listen.

406
00:27:50,171 --> 00:27:51,839
Yes. Go ahead.

407
00:27:51,872 --> 00:27:55,242
The call was cancelled.
You do not need to be here.

408
00:27:55,276 --> 00:27:57,878
Please leave the building.

409
00:27:57,912 --> 00:28:00,281
What do you mean,
the call was cancelled?

410
00:28:00,314 --> 00:28:02,082
I do not need you.

411
00:28:02,116 --> 00:28:04,118
Please get away from my door.

412
00:28:04,151 --> 00:28:05,386
<i>Mr. Chamberlain.</i>

413
00:28:05,419 --> 00:28:08,088
<i>Let them know that Lifeguard
called the police department</i>

414
00:28:08,122 --> 00:28:10,291
<i>specifically to cancel
the dispatch.</i>

415
00:28:10,724 --> 00:28:13,160
The company...

416
00:28:13,194 --> 00:28:17,731
My company, they called the police,
and said I do not need help.

417
00:28:17,765 --> 00:28:19,133
So please leave.

418
00:28:19,166 --> 00:28:21,135
We haven't been notified
of any cancellation.

419
00:28:21,168 --> 00:28:23,938
We've been out here waiting
for you for a half an hour.

420
00:28:23,971 --> 00:28:25,239
We have other things to do.

421
00:28:25,272 --> 00:28:28,442
You need to open this door so
we can get this over with, sir.

422
00:28:28,475 --> 00:28:29,910
I will not.

423
00:28:29,944 --> 00:28:33,981
Mr. Chamberlain, we told you we did
not come here because of a crime.

424
00:28:34,014 --> 00:28:36,150
You have nothing
to worry about.

425
00:28:36,183 --> 00:28:38,352
But if you continue
not listening to us,

426
00:28:38,385 --> 00:28:40,921
we're gonna have to use force
to get what we need.

427
00:28:46,060 --> 00:28:47,194
Force?

428
00:28:49,263 --> 00:28:50,931
Force?

429
00:28:50,965 --> 00:28:52,499
<i>Mr. Chamberlain?</i>

430
00:28:52,534 --> 00:28:54,935
<i>Mr. Chamberlain, what's going on?
Where are you now?</i>

431
00:28:56,437 --> 00:28:58,372
Bust to my apartment.

432
00:28:58,405 --> 00:29:01,008
- <i>What?</i>
- Force.

433
00:29:01,041 --> 00:29:04,945
- They... They said, "force".
- <i>Force to do what?</i>

434
00:29:04,979 --> 00:29:06,146
I don't know.

435
00:29:07,381 --> 00:29:08,916
Probably kill me.

436
00:29:09,850 --> 00:29:11,118
<i>What're you...</i>

437
00:29:11,785 --> 00:29:14,522
Why are they doing this to me?

438
00:29:14,556 --> 00:29:18,092
<i>Mr. Chamberlain? Is there a way
you can hand the call box to them?</i>

439
00:29:18,125 --> 00:29:20,861
<i>I'm happy to speak to them.
If you think that would help.</i>

440
00:29:32,206 --> 00:29:33,907
Okay.

441
00:29:33,941 --> 00:29:36,443
I'm gonna open my door now.

442
00:29:36,477 --> 00:29:38,979
So, you can see that
there's no emergency.

443
00:29:40,548 --> 00:29:42,550
I got the company here

444
00:29:42,584 --> 00:29:44,852
and they will tell you that...

445
00:29:44,885 --> 00:29:47,888
That... That they canceled
the call.

446
00:29:52,159 --> 00:29:54,828
- I'm opening the door.
- We're waiting.

447
00:30:26,126 --> 00:30:27,194
See...

448
00:30:28,329 --> 00:30:29,564
No emergency.

449
00:30:31,599 --> 00:30:33,200
Alright.

450
00:30:33,233 --> 00:30:35,302
Can you let us in
so we can check you out?

451
00:30:35,603 --> 00:30:36,904
No.

452
00:30:36,937 --> 00:30:38,606
Mr. Chamberlain,
take the slap lock off.

453
00:30:38,640 --> 00:30:40,974
We need to make sure
that you're okay.

454
00:30:41,008 --> 00:30:42,443
- <i>Mr. Chamberlain...</i>
- No.

455
00:30:42,476 --> 00:30:43,645
Stop resisting the door.

456
00:30:43,678 --> 00:30:46,447
Just get your foot away
from the door, Mr. Chamberlain.

457
00:30:46,480 --> 00:30:49,249
You can't come
into my apartment.

458
00:30:49,283 --> 00:30:50,618
Stop resisting.

459
00:30:51,586 --> 00:30:53,087
Push.

460
00:30:53,120 --> 00:30:55,255
Stop fighting, son.
Come on, just let us in.

461
00:30:55,289 --> 00:30:57,224
Who the hell
you're calling "son"?

462
00:30:57,257 --> 00:30:59,293
- <i>Officers, hello?</i>
- I'm 70 years old.

463
00:30:59,326 --> 00:31:00,662
Open up the damn door.

464
00:31:00,695 --> 00:31:01,796
<i>Mr. Chamberlain...</i>

465
00:31:01,830 --> 00:31:05,899
Get your foot away from the door
and let us do our job.

466
00:31:05,933 --> 00:31:07,334
Tell them. Tell them.

467
00:31:07,368 --> 00:31:10,538
<i>Officers this is the
Lifeguard Medical Alerts company.</i>

468
00:31:10,572 --> 00:31:13,073
<i>We cancelled the dispatch
for Mr. Chamberlain's home.</i>

469
00:31:13,107 --> 00:31:15,409
<i>He does not have an emergency.
You're free to leave.</i>

470
00:31:15,442 --> 00:31:19,012
- Mr. Chamberlain.
- Leave me alone.

471
00:31:26,420 --> 00:31:28,322
God damn it.

472
00:31:28,355 --> 00:31:29,824
Mr. Chamberlain?

473
00:31:29,858 --> 00:31:32,926
<i>Mr. Chamberlain,
what was all that noise? Are you alright?</i>

474
00:31:32,960 --> 00:31:34,428
We've not come here
because of a crime.

475
00:31:34,461 --> 00:31:36,564
But you're making us think
you have something to hide.

476
00:31:37,464 --> 00:31:40,367
<i>Hello?
What's going on?</i>

477
00:31:42,236 --> 00:31:46,940
They... They're trying to force
my door open.

478
00:31:46,974 --> 00:31:49,276
<i>Is the door
closed now? Are you all right?</i>

479
00:31:49,309 --> 00:31:51,713
No, I am not alright.

480
00:31:51,746 --> 00:31:56,250
The White Plains Police is trying
to break into my apartment.

481
00:32:02,590 --> 00:32:03,924
Hey!

482
00:32:05,125 --> 00:32:07,961
Calm down. Calm yourself.

483
00:32:07,995 --> 00:32:10,130
We've been out
for 45 minutes, Sarge.

484
00:32:10,164 --> 00:32:13,333
I don't want to hear another
word out of you. Stand over there, now!

485
00:32:21,576 --> 00:32:26,146
What are we doing here? We can't use
force to get into this guy's place.

486
00:32:26,180 --> 00:32:27,649
Like hell, we can.

487
00:32:27,682 --> 00:32:30,117
Sarge, you heard him.
He sounded like he was scared.

488
00:32:30,150 --> 00:32:32,219
Should we even be
doing this, if he's escalated?

489
00:32:32,252 --> 00:32:33,987
He needs to learn,
he's not the boss.

490
00:32:34,021 --> 00:32:36,457
He doesn't have an emergency.
What are we doing here anymore?

491
00:32:36,490 --> 00:32:39,193
What do you mean?
We just got the door slammed in our face.

492
00:32:39,226 --> 00:32:40,494
I don't know what's going on.

493
00:32:40,528 --> 00:32:41,995
- Sarge, he's...
- Rossi!

494
00:32:42,029 --> 00:32:43,731
I am done being patient.

495
00:32:43,765 --> 00:32:46,166
It's gonna be our ass
if we leave here and he dies.

496
00:32:46,200 --> 00:32:48,402
Or if he's got some half-dead
hooker locked up in there.

497
00:32:48,435 --> 00:32:50,304
- He was...
- Rossi!

498
00:32:50,337 --> 00:32:52,473
Something's going on in there.

499
00:32:52,507 --> 00:32:55,543
Okay, I'm not leaving
until we get in that apartment.

500
00:32:58,045 --> 00:32:59,379
How we're gonna do that?

501
00:33:00,715 --> 00:33:02,149
Let's use the irons.

502
00:33:03,083 --> 00:33:06,019
It'll take FD two minutes
to get over here.

503
00:33:06,053 --> 00:33:07,722
Break the seal with a Halligan.

504
00:33:07,755 --> 00:33:10,491
If that doesn't work we'll take
the damn door off its hinges.

505
00:33:17,464 --> 00:33:20,234
Alright. Call rescue 88.
Get them over here as soon as possible.

506
00:33:20,267 --> 00:33:22,202
This is 87.
We need rescue 88

507
00:33:22,236 --> 00:33:24,471
at this well-check on South Lex
as soon as possible.

508
00:33:28,175 --> 00:33:29,409
<i>Yes?</i>

509
00:33:29,443 --> 00:33:32,379
Sir, this is Parks. I'm on that
EDP well-check on South Lex.

510
00:33:32,412 --> 00:33:34,147
<i>You make
visual contact yet?</i>

511
00:33:34,181 --> 00:33:37,117
Not yet. He a...
open the door a crack.

512
00:33:37,150 --> 00:33:38,385
We couldn't really
see anything.

513
00:33:38,418 --> 00:33:40,187
Then he freak out
and slammed it shut.

514
00:33:40,220 --> 00:33:42,456
We're gonna need more support
here, though. Maybe, SRT.

515
00:33:42,489 --> 00:33:45,359
<i>You have to be patient.
You might just have to wait him out.</i>

516
00:33:45,392 --> 00:33:48,630
- <i>Who else is with you?</i>
- Jackson and Rossi.

517
00:33:48,663 --> 00:33:53,535
<i>All right, I'll send SRT. Just stay
in control and keep Jackson calm.</i>

518
00:33:53,568 --> 00:33:55,570
<i>We don't want another
Second Street mess.</i>

519
00:33:55,603 --> 00:33:57,505
Yes, sir. I'll keep him
in line.

520
00:33:57,539 --> 00:33:58,540
<i>Good.</i>

521
00:34:07,180 --> 00:34:08,415
What's the word, Sarge?

522
00:34:08,448 --> 00:34:10,450
We just gotta get in there.
SRT's on the way.

523
00:34:10,484 --> 00:34:12,486
Jackson, you stay here.
Rossi, you're with me.

524
00:34:12,520 --> 00:34:14,288
- Let's go talk to 88.
- Yes, sir.

525
00:34:43,150 --> 00:34:44,619
Freeze!

526
00:35:03,938 --> 00:35:05,673
Our secret.

527
00:35:06,340 --> 00:35:08,175
Where they keep...

528
00:35:23,490 --> 00:35:25,560
<i>Mr. Chamberlain,
this is Candace again.</i>

529
00:35:25,593 --> 00:35:28,362
<i>I spoke to my supervisor about
what's happening. Are you okay?</i>

530
00:35:36,403 --> 00:35:40,340
They... I... I think
they're leaving now.

531
00:35:40,374 --> 00:35:42,242
- <i>They are?</i>
- Yeah. Uh...

532
00:35:43,143 --> 00:35:47,548
There's only...
There's only one left.

533
00:35:47,582 --> 00:35:49,349
Is...

534
00:35:56,691 --> 00:35:58,926
Here we go. Go.

535
00:36:02,830 --> 00:36:03,865
Officer!

536
00:36:03,898 --> 00:36:05,165
What's going on?

537
00:36:06,266 --> 00:36:07,300
Is Kenny, okay?

538
00:36:07,334 --> 00:36:09,504
He's gonna be fine.
As long as he listens to us.

539
00:36:09,537 --> 00:36:11,606
Look, I can talk to him
if that'll help.

540
00:36:11,639 --> 00:36:13,675
Don't worry about it.
We've got it handled.

541
00:36:16,978 --> 00:36:20,313
Uh... My uncle is sick.

542
00:36:20,347 --> 00:36:22,282
You're gonna break in his home.

543
00:36:22,315 --> 00:36:23,718
He's gonna be fine, ma'am.

544
00:36:23,751 --> 00:36:26,954
- No, no, you can't do that.
- Ma'am, shut up!

545
00:36:26,988 --> 00:36:29,489
Mind your business
and get to where you're going,

546
00:36:29,524 --> 00:36:31,258
or we're gonna have
a big problem.

547
00:36:45,740 --> 00:36:48,910
Hey, there's gonna be people
watching us.

548
00:36:48,943 --> 00:36:51,679
We can't break into this
guy's place with an audience.

549
00:36:51,713 --> 00:36:53,313
Rossi, where do you think
you are?

550
00:36:53,781 --> 00:36:55,415
Hmm?

551
00:36:55,449 --> 00:36:57,350
This isn't The Hamptons.

552
00:36:57,384 --> 00:36:58,953
If you knock on any one
of these doors,

553
00:36:58,986 --> 00:37:00,655
you're gonna find
something illegal.

554
00:37:00,688 --> 00:37:03,925
Whether it's drugs,
prostitution, stolen merchandise.

555
00:37:03,958 --> 00:37:07,260
You're going to find it.
That is the job.

556
00:37:07,294 --> 00:37:08,996
If you don't want
to participate, fine.

557
00:37:09,030 --> 00:37:11,666
Your stand over there
and you keep your mouth shut.

558
00:37:49,469 --> 00:37:52,339
- Hello?
- <i>Daddy, what's happening?</i>

559
00:37:52,372 --> 00:37:53,975
<i>Carol said she talked
to the company.</i>

560
00:37:54,008 --> 00:37:56,844
<i>She's worried something's
gonna happen with the police.</i>

561
00:37:56,878 --> 00:37:59,614
Oh, baby,
I'm taking care of it.

562
00:37:59,647 --> 00:38:01,582
I'm fine.

563
00:38:01,616 --> 00:38:04,886
They got no warrant.
No probable cause.

564
00:38:04,919 --> 00:38:06,621
There's nothing they can do.

565
00:38:06,654 --> 00:38:09,356
<i>But... Wait... What...</i>

566
00:38:09,389 --> 00:38:11,959
- <i>Are you sure, you're okay?</i>
- Yeah. I'm fine.

567
00:38:11,993 --> 00:38:14,629
I tell you, I'm fine.

568
00:38:14,662 --> 00:38:16,864
I'm fine. I told you.

569
00:38:16,898 --> 00:38:19,033
I told you, I'm fine.

570
00:38:19,066 --> 00:38:21,002
<i>You're taking
your medication?</i>

571
00:38:21,035 --> 00:38:24,505
Yes. I've been taking
my damn medication.

572
00:38:26,373 --> 00:38:28,375
What the...

573
00:38:28,408 --> 00:38:30,945
<i>What? What is it, Daddy?
What happened?</i>

574
00:38:30,978 --> 00:38:33,346
<i>Hello, Daddy, what's going on?</i>

575
00:38:33,380 --> 00:38:34,982
Something's
happening out there.

576
00:38:35,016 --> 00:38:37,552
<i>What? What do you mean?
With the police?</i>

577
00:38:40,621 --> 00:38:42,023
<i>Daddy, talk to me,
please. Hello?</i>

578
00:38:42,056 --> 00:38:43,591
Something's going on.

579
00:38:43,624 --> 00:38:45,793
- <i>What is it? Tell me.</i>
- Oh, look...

580
00:38:45,827 --> 00:38:48,495
- I got to go, baby. I'll call you back.
- <i>No, wait, hold on...</i>

581
00:38:52,700 --> 00:38:53,901
Good.

582
00:38:56,637 --> 00:38:58,606
What up, Sarge?

583
00:38:58,639 --> 00:39:01,374
Oh, no.

584
00:39:02,009 --> 00:39:03,410
Hey.

585
00:39:14,055 --> 00:39:15,488
Go away.

586
00:39:24,832 --> 00:39:27,400
- Bringing in the big gun.
- What's up, big guy.

587
00:39:29,737 --> 00:39:30,705
Alright.

588
00:39:30,738 --> 00:39:32,372
What's up, man?
It's been a while.

589
00:39:41,215 --> 00:39:44,118
We've got a psychotic
threat inside of the apartment.

590
00:39:44,151 --> 00:39:45,418
What's happening?

591
00:39:57,665 --> 00:39:59,967
So we got here on 5:30.
Knock on the door.

592
00:40:00,001 --> 00:40:01,369
He's telling us
everything's fine,

593
00:40:01,401 --> 00:40:04,572
but we're hearing some strange
things comin' out of that apartment.

594
00:40:04,605 --> 00:40:05,873
<i>He's emotionally disturbed</i>

595
00:40:05,907 --> 00:40:08,142
<i>and I think he's got someone
else in there with him.</i>

596
00:40:08,175 --> 00:40:09,409
But you never got
a visual?

597
00:40:09,442 --> 00:40:12,079
Not a good one.
He's been non-compliant the whole time.

598
00:40:12,113 --> 00:40:14,481
We just need to breach
the door and get in there.

599
00:40:14,515 --> 00:40:16,717
He's been playing games
with us for way too long.

600
00:40:25,660 --> 00:40:27,561
Did you hear anyone else
from inside?

601
00:40:27,595 --> 00:40:28,829
We're hearing
someone else.

602
00:40:28,863 --> 00:40:30,765
It doesn't make sense to me
any other way.

603
00:40:30,798 --> 00:40:33,234
We can start with the
irons, see where that gets us.

604
00:40:33,267 --> 00:40:34,769
On a steel door?
Good luck.

605
00:40:34,802 --> 00:40:36,203
It's gonna
take a while.

606
00:40:40,741 --> 00:40:42,677
What's the rookie's deal?

607
00:40:42,710 --> 00:40:45,012
He's bein' a crybaby.
Thinks we're not bein'

608
00:40:45,046 --> 00:40:46,948
emotionally
sensitive enough.

609
00:40:46,981 --> 00:40:48,115
Got it.

610
00:40:52,787 --> 00:40:54,088
Let's clear up,
make some room.

611
00:40:58,693 --> 00:41:00,861
- Jackson?
- Yes, sir.

612
00:41:00,895 --> 00:41:03,631
Sarge, why don't you
pop that taser open too?

613
00:41:21,215 --> 00:41:23,117
This is 87 to Dispatch.

614
00:41:23,150 --> 00:41:25,820
We're commencing the breach
at 135 South Lex.

615
00:41:25,853 --> 00:41:27,121
<i>Copy that, 87.</i>

616
00:41:35,262 --> 00:41:38,032
- Sarge.
- What?

617
00:41:38,065 --> 00:41:40,835
With all due respect,
you cannot use a Taser on this guy.

618
00:41:40,868 --> 00:41:42,069
Why the hell not?

619
00:41:42,103 --> 00:41:43,738
They said he has
a heart condition.

620
00:41:43,771 --> 00:41:44,972
What do you suggest we use?

621
00:41:45,006 --> 00:41:46,941
I suggest we get the hell
out of here, okay.

622
00:41:46,974 --> 00:41:48,676
We don't need to
be here anymore.

623
00:41:48,709 --> 00:41:50,578
He poses no threat
to anyone.

624
00:41:50,611 --> 00:41:52,613
You think gettin' the door
shut in our faces,

625
00:41:52,646 --> 00:41:55,883
screaming all kinds of nonsense,
isn't posin' a threat to anyone?

626
00:41:55,916 --> 00:41:58,552
We are not leaving
until we get that door open.

627
00:42:01,655 --> 00:42:04,792
Look, now that SRT's here,
I may just go back to the hub.

628
00:42:04,825 --> 00:42:06,027
You're not goin'
anywhere.

629
00:42:37,158 --> 00:42:39,827
Yo, Kenneth, you remember me?
It's Sgt. Flannigan.

630
00:42:39,860 --> 00:42:41,095
Yeah, I remember you

631
00:42:41,128 --> 00:42:43,097
from my walkin' post
around here.

632
00:42:45,166 --> 00:42:48,969
We're gonna give you one last
chance to open this door, buddy.

633
00:42:54,208 --> 00:42:57,711
Come on, Kenneth, we don't want
to have to bust your door down.

634
00:43:00,114 --> 00:43:01,582
No, thank you.

635
00:43:02,116 --> 00:43:03,117
I...

636
00:43:03,684 --> 00:43:05,219
I don't need your help.

637
00:43:06,420 --> 00:43:08,622
You're gonna have to
let us in some time.

638
00:43:09,690 --> 00:43:11,125
Come on,
you're a grown-ass man.

639
00:43:13,394 --> 00:43:17,131
Enough of this crybaby stuff.
Let's handle this like adults.

640
00:43:17,164 --> 00:43:21,735
Just let us in, we'll check you
out, then we'll leave.

641
00:43:21,769 --> 00:43:25,072
I'm tellin' you, I'm fine.

642
00:43:25,106 --> 00:43:27,675
I'm not sick,
I do not need your help.

643
00:43:29,143 --> 00:43:31,912
Thank you
for your time.

644
00:43:31,946 --> 00:43:35,749
But please,
get away from my door.

645
00:43:35,783 --> 00:43:37,718
Hey, hey, I gotta take a
piss, you know?

646
00:43:40,788 --> 00:43:43,424
Yeah, come on, let your old buddy
in, let, let me use the can.

647
00:43:43,457 --> 00:43:45,092
Come on.

648
00:43:45,126 --> 00:43:46,360
Open the door!

649
00:43:55,903 --> 00:43:57,838
It's your last chance,
my friend.

650
00:44:03,077 --> 00:44:04,678
All right,
you made your choice.

651
00:44:10,985 --> 00:44:12,319
Fire in the hole, boys.

652
00:44:18,425 --> 00:44:19,426
Ready?

653
00:44:21,962 --> 00:44:24,398
No! No! Oh!

654
00:44:49,290 --> 00:44:50,925
- <i>Hello, Mr. Chamberlain?</i>
- Yes.

655
00:44:51,959 --> 00:44:53,928
- <i>What's... what's going on?</i>
- The White...

656
00:44:53,961 --> 00:44:55,896
- White Plains police...
- <i>What is that noise?</i>

657
00:44:55,930 --> 00:44:57,364
...is trying
to break down my door.

658
00:44:58,165 --> 00:44:59,333
Help me.

659
00:45:08,108 --> 00:45:09,210
Come on.

660
00:45:11,879 --> 00:45:14,815
You can end this
by openin' the door!

661
00:45:14,848 --> 00:45:17,519
<i>Hold on. Please calm
down, Mr. Chamberlain, it's okay.</i>

662
00:45:17,552 --> 00:45:20,788
<i>I thought you said the officers were
leaving, but they're still there?</i>

663
00:45:20,821 --> 00:45:22,790
Yes!

664
00:45:22,823 --> 00:45:24,425
<i>What is that noise?</i>

665
00:45:24,458 --> 00:45:27,828
That's the police
at my door.

666
00:45:27,861 --> 00:45:31,533
We're not gonna hurt you,
Kenneth, Just open this damn door.

667
00:45:31,566 --> 00:45:36,203
No. You are not coming
into my home.

668
00:45:38,105 --> 00:45:40,441
It's not up to you anymore.

669
00:45:40,474 --> 00:45:43,744
Got ourselves one
stubborn Cocoa Puff, huh?

670
00:45:45,212 --> 00:45:48,415
All right, all right,
all right, let me try.

671
00:45:48,449 --> 00:45:51,485
<i>Mr. Chamberlain, what's happening?
Please talk to me.</i>

672
00:45:52,687 --> 00:45:57,224
I did not call you.
I do not need you. I am not sick.

673
00:45:59,594 --> 00:46:01,295
You're not coming
into my home.

674
00:46:01,328 --> 00:46:03,264
- <i>Officers... Hello?</i>
- They're trying to...

675
00:46:03,297 --> 00:46:06,467
enter my home
without a warrant.

676
00:46:06,500 --> 00:46:09,236
With... Without probable cause.

677
00:46:10,170 --> 00:46:11,372
This is illegal.

678
00:46:13,107 --> 00:46:15,242
- Agh!
- <i>What was that?</i>

679
00:46:15,276 --> 00:46:18,212
Wedge it. Wedge it.
Get it, get it, get it! Get in there.

680
00:46:20,447 --> 00:46:24,586
Get the hell
out of my building.

681
00:46:24,619 --> 00:46:27,522
- You leave! Now!
- <i>Officers...</i>

682
00:46:28,355 --> 00:46:30,592
Help me! Help me!

683
00:46:30,625 --> 00:46:32,359
I need help!

684
00:46:32,393 --> 00:46:33,994
Get out of here.

685
00:46:37,131 --> 00:46:38,465
<i>Sir, please respond.</i>

686
00:46:41,569 --> 00:46:44,171
- Help!
- What the hell's going on down here?

687
00:46:44,204 --> 00:46:45,239
People are trying to sleep.

688
00:46:45,272 --> 00:46:47,174
Sir, please,
you need to go back inside,

689
00:46:47,207 --> 00:46:48,942
- or get down the stairs.
- What's going on?

690
00:46:48,976 --> 00:46:50,411
Sir, get down
the stairs. Please.

691
00:46:50,444 --> 00:46:52,146
Why is that man
screaming like that?

692
00:46:52,179 --> 00:46:54,148
Sir, please, you need to
get down the stairs.

693
00:46:54,181 --> 00:46:56,050
<i>Mr. Chamberlain,
what's happening?</i>

694
00:46:57,585 --> 00:47:00,220
All of this banging...

695
00:47:00,254 --> 00:47:02,489
Hey! Hey! Hey!

696
00:47:02,524 --> 00:47:03,857
Don't touch me!

697
00:47:03,891 --> 00:47:06,427
I'm so sorry, ma'am.
We have an unstable situation going on.

698
00:47:06,460 --> 00:47:08,862
- Please move down the stairs.
- Kenneth! Come on!

699
00:47:08,896 --> 00:47:10,397
You're gonna open
this door or what?

700
00:47:10,431 --> 00:47:12,933
I told you,
I gotta take a piss.

701
00:47:12,966 --> 00:47:14,935
I'm gonna come in
and take a piss.

702
00:47:14,968 --> 00:47:17,505
This is illegal!

703
00:47:17,539 --> 00:47:19,173
I gotta go to work
in the morning.

704
00:47:19,206 --> 00:47:20,575
All this fuss
going on down here.

705
00:47:22,376 --> 00:47:24,078
Come on, Kenneth.

706
00:47:24,111 --> 00:47:25,379
Just leave!

707
00:47:28,382 --> 00:47:31,485
<i>Mr. Chamberlain,
talk to me, please.</i>

708
00:47:36,056 --> 00:47:37,424
Hello.

709
00:47:37,458 --> 00:47:40,494
<i>Pa. It's Junior.
Are you okay? What's going on?</i>

710
00:47:40,528 --> 00:47:43,964
Junior. Hey, look,
I can't talk right now.

711
00:47:43,997 --> 00:47:45,432
Kick it open!

712
00:47:45,466 --> 00:47:47,602
The police
are outside my door.

713
00:47:47,635 --> 00:47:49,103
<i>I'm coming over.</i>

714
00:47:49,136 --> 00:47:52,072
No, no,
I don't want you over here.

715
00:47:52,106 --> 00:47:54,408
I don't know what
these cops are gonna do.

716
00:47:54,809 --> 00:47:56,276
Kenny!

717
00:47:56,310 --> 00:47:58,479
Come on, buddy,
what you got behind the door?

718
00:47:58,513 --> 00:48:00,247
<i>Are you okay, Pa?</i>

719
00:48:00,280 --> 00:48:01,482
I'll take care of it.

720
00:48:01,516 --> 00:48:04,218
Kenny!
Take this damn lock off!

721
00:48:04,251 --> 00:48:05,352
Let us do our job.

722
00:48:05,386 --> 00:48:07,555
You're making this hard
on your own.

723
00:48:07,589 --> 00:48:09,624
Take this damn
lock off, Kenneth!

724
00:48:09,657 --> 00:48:11,091
What is all this noise?

725
00:48:11,125 --> 00:48:13,127
Something's going on
in that man's apartment.

726
00:48:13,160 --> 00:48:15,630
They keep banging on the door.
They're trying to break it down.

727
00:48:15,663 --> 00:48:18,365
They've been calling him names,
tormenting him. This is ain't right.

728
00:48:18,399 --> 00:48:20,234
- Did he do something?
- I don't know.

729
00:48:20,267 --> 00:48:21,935
- Is he inside?
- Yeah, he in there.

730
00:48:21,969 --> 00:48:23,170
Tonya, you see this?

731
00:48:23,203 --> 00:48:24,304
It's my uncle's apartment.

732
00:48:24,338 --> 00:48:25,439
This is your uncle's?

733
00:48:25,472 --> 00:48:26,574
Does he have a problem?

734
00:48:29,611 --> 00:48:30,678
Y'all have been
here all morning...

735
00:48:30,712 --> 00:48:33,180
Please step back down
on that ledge, please.

736
00:48:33,213 --> 00:48:34,616
We're handling this.
Thank you.

737
00:48:34,649 --> 00:48:38,051
- Yeah, I see that you're handling this.
- Step back down. Thank you.

738
00:48:38,085 --> 00:48:40,220
<i>Tonyia's there, right?</i>

739
00:48:40,254 --> 00:48:43,691
No, no. No, Tonyia is not here.

740
00:48:43,725 --> 00:48:45,627
<i>Why don't you
talk to her, Pa?</i>

741
00:48:45,660 --> 00:48:47,227
<i>Do they know
about your condition?</i>

742
00:48:47,261 --> 00:48:48,495
They don't care.

743
00:48:48,530 --> 00:48:51,599
You know how these
cops are around here.

744
00:48:51,633 --> 00:48:54,702
<i>I've got to call Tonyia,
to make sure she knows what's going on.</i>

745
00:48:54,736 --> 00:48:56,370
<i>Okay, Pa?</i>

746
00:48:56,403 --> 00:48:58,138
- Okay.
- <i>Everything is gonna be okay.</i>

747
00:49:03,410 --> 00:49:04,978
<i>Mr. Chamberlain,
are you okay?</i>

748
00:49:05,012 --> 00:49:06,079
<i>Are they still there?</i>

749
00:49:09,183 --> 00:49:11,084
Mr. Chamberlain.

750
00:49:11,118 --> 00:49:12,554
What is going on?

751
00:49:12,587 --> 00:49:14,021
I don't know.

752
00:49:14,054 --> 00:49:17,357
Please, ladies and gentlemen,
we need you to clear this area.

753
00:49:17,391 --> 00:49:19,159
It's unsafe for you
to be here.

754
00:49:19,193 --> 00:49:21,094
You can't tell us what to do.
We live here.

755
00:49:21,128 --> 00:49:23,230
Police's always treating us
like we don't belong here.

756
00:49:23,263 --> 00:49:24,398
- This is our home.
- Right.

757
00:49:24,431 --> 00:49:27,367
For your own safety,
I need you to clear this area.

758
00:49:29,303 --> 00:49:31,506
- Please. Thank you.
- I ain't going nowhere.

759
00:49:36,210 --> 00:49:37,411
It's not gonna help if you...

760
00:49:37,444 --> 00:49:39,413
All right! All right! All right!

761
00:49:39,446 --> 00:49:41,616
Mr. Chamberlain,

762
00:49:41,649 --> 00:49:44,084
You understand you're
disobeying a direct order

763
00:49:44,117 --> 00:49:46,119
from a police officer.
You know, you could be

764
00:49:46,153 --> 00:49:47,287
arrested for that right now.

765
00:49:47,321 --> 00:49:50,692
No. This is no
lawful instruction.

766
00:49:50,725 --> 00:49:54,194
I'm allowed to be
secure in my home

767
00:49:54,228 --> 00:49:57,699
without unreasonable search
or seizure.

768
00:49:57,732 --> 00:50:01,168
No one shall issue
without probable cause.

769
00:50:01,201 --> 00:50:03,303
Read the damn constitution!

770
00:50:04,672 --> 00:50:06,039
You have no warrant.

771
00:50:06,841 --> 00:50:09,343
And you have
no probable cause.

772
00:50:09,376 --> 00:50:13,280
I'm a former
United States Marine.

773
00:50:14,516 --> 00:50:19,186
And if you enter
my home unlawfully,

774
00:50:20,588 --> 00:50:23,525
I will defend myself.

775
00:50:23,558 --> 00:50:25,192
Be all you can be.

776
00:50:27,662 --> 00:50:31,498
Please. Get out!

777
00:50:31,533 --> 00:50:35,135
<i>Mr. Chamberlain.
What is that?</i>

778
00:50:35,168 --> 00:50:37,170
- <i>What is that?</i>
- Undo that lock!

779
00:50:38,840 --> 00:50:40,440
Come on, buddy!

780
00:50:40,474 --> 00:50:41,709
<i>Are you alright?</i>

781
00:50:41,743 --> 00:50:43,243
If you're doing
anything illegal,

782
00:50:43,277 --> 00:50:44,444
or you have
somebody in there,

783
00:50:44,478 --> 00:50:47,347
we're gonna find out.
We're not playing games anymore.

784
00:50:47,381 --> 00:50:49,149
I'm not playing games either.

785
00:50:49,182 --> 00:50:51,184
- <i>Sir, talk to me!</i>
- You're not coming

786
00:50:51,218 --> 00:50:52,452
into my apartment!

787
00:50:54,321 --> 00:50:56,189
See if you can find
a way up on the roof.

788
00:50:56,223 --> 00:50:59,293
Find one of his windows, distract
him, get him away from that door.

789
00:50:59,694 --> 00:51:00,795
I got it!

790
00:51:03,598 --> 00:51:04,832
I'll do it.

791
00:51:06,634 --> 00:51:07,769
All right, go.

792
00:51:13,206 --> 00:51:15,242
You're not
coming into my apartment.

793
00:51:15,275 --> 00:51:18,478
Mr. Chamberlain.
You need to undo that lock.

794
00:51:18,513 --> 00:51:20,682
- I did not call you.
- <i>Mr. Chamberlain...</i>

795
00:51:20,715 --> 00:51:22,215
I've done nothing wrong.

796
00:51:23,051 --> 00:51:25,653
These cops have
broke my damn door!

797
00:51:28,623 --> 00:51:29,724
Pull, pull, pull!

798
00:51:29,757 --> 00:51:32,159
<i>Talk to me, please.
What's happening?</i>

799
00:51:41,201 --> 00:51:43,905
Get the bolt cutters,
were gonna cut that slap lock.

800
00:51:43,938 --> 00:51:47,107
Have your guys tack up.
And bring in a shield.

801
00:51:48,208 --> 00:51:49,644
Kenneth!

802
00:51:49,677 --> 00:51:51,512
We got you surrounded, buddy.

803
00:51:52,580 --> 00:51:54,582
You got no choice.

804
00:51:54,616 --> 00:51:56,383
It's time to start listening.

805
00:52:02,289 --> 00:52:03,323
No!

806
00:52:09,797 --> 00:52:11,398
...without cause.

807
00:52:16,203 --> 00:52:20,374
Mr. Chamberlain. Mr. Chamberlain.
It's okay. It's okay. Look.

808
00:52:23,711 --> 00:52:25,445
It's okay.

809
00:52:25,479 --> 00:52:27,314
It's all right. I'm just...

810
00:52:27,347 --> 00:52:31,251
I'm just here because I want to
have a conversation with you.

811
00:52:31,284 --> 00:52:32,553
I'm not gonna bang
on anything.

812
00:52:32,587 --> 00:52:35,389
I'm not gonna... I'm not gonna
try to force my way inside here.

813
00:52:35,422 --> 00:52:38,926
I'm just... I'm just
gonna kneel like this.

814
00:52:38,960 --> 00:52:41,663
I just want to have a friendly
conversation with you.

815
00:52:47,769 --> 00:52:48,770
Yeah.

816
00:52:58,946 --> 00:53:00,313
My name's Rossi.

817
00:53:01,015 --> 00:53:02,750
Michael Ross.

818
00:53:04,451 --> 00:53:05,753
See my hands right here.

819
00:53:12,827 --> 00:53:15,830
I know this is difficult
for you, Mr. Chamberlain.

820
00:53:15,863 --> 00:53:19,433
And I know that these officers, they're
not making you feel safe, but you...

821
00:53:19,466 --> 00:53:23,270
do me a favor and just... just...
just put that knife down.

822
00:53:24,271 --> 00:53:25,439
Can you...

823
00:53:25,472 --> 00:53:27,675
Can you put that
knife down for me?

824
00:53:30,778 --> 00:53:32,914
Can you put down that knife
for me, please?

825
00:53:32,947 --> 00:53:38,553
And then you and I, we can have a nice,
friendly, calm, calm conversation.

826
00:53:40,320 --> 00:53:41,756
I haven't done anything.

827
00:53:42,690 --> 00:53:46,226
I'm just in my... home alone.

828
00:53:48,529 --> 00:53:49,697
I didn't do nothing.

829
00:53:51,866 --> 00:53:56,369
I'm here alone in my own.

830
00:53:56,403 --> 00:53:58,271
Ain't nobody else here.

831
00:53:58,806 --> 00:54:00,608
Just me.

832
00:54:00,641 --> 00:54:01,909
I just want to go to sleep.

833
00:54:01,943 --> 00:54:04,512
I know, I know, I know.

834
00:54:04,545 --> 00:54:07,648
Look, I'm just here
alone too, okay.

835
00:54:07,682 --> 00:54:10,450
Look, there's nobody else
here with me, okay?

836
00:54:10,484 --> 00:54:11,886
So if you could just...

837
00:54:13,487 --> 00:54:15,056
You could just open up
these bars for me.

838
00:54:15,089 --> 00:54:17,390
Look at me.
Just me alone.

839
00:54:17,424 --> 00:54:19,292
- Just you?
- I could come in there.

840
00:54:19,326 --> 00:54:21,596
- Nobody else?
- Nobody else, I...

841
00:54:21,629 --> 00:54:24,331
I could come in there,
just me, okay?

842
00:54:24,364 --> 00:54:28,970
Just me. And I could just take a peek
around, make sure everything is good

843
00:54:29,003 --> 00:54:30,805
and I can go back
to the other officers

844
00:54:30,838 --> 00:54:33,007
and let them know
that you're okay.

845
00:54:33,040 --> 00:54:35,576
And you can go back
to sleep, Mr. Chamberlain.

846
00:54:38,846 --> 00:54:40,815
Put that gun away first.

847
00:54:42,583 --> 00:54:43,618
Put it over there.

848
00:54:43,651 --> 00:54:44,819
I'll tell you what.

849
00:54:44,852 --> 00:54:46,020
- No, don't!
- No, no, no.

850
00:54:46,053 --> 00:54:47,989
Look, look, look, look, look.

851
00:54:48,823 --> 00:54:49,857
See?

852
00:54:53,928 --> 00:54:55,362
All right?

853
00:54:59,967 --> 00:55:01,468
What do you say, huh?

854
00:55:01,501 --> 00:55:03,704
- Yeah.
- All right? So if you could just...

855
00:55:03,738 --> 00:55:05,506
Could you unlock these bars?

856
00:55:05,540 --> 00:55:07,809
Unlock ' em and I can...

857
00:55:07,842 --> 00:55:09,710
I can come in. Just me.

858
00:55:09,744 --> 00:55:10,778
Nobody else?

859
00:55:10,812 --> 00:55:12,947
Nobody else. Nobody else at all.
It's just...

860
00:55:12,980 --> 00:55:15,616
They don't even know I'm doing
this, Mr. Chamberlain.

861
00:55:17,051 --> 00:55:18,586
So what do you say, huh?

862
00:55:20,453 --> 00:55:21,522
All right?

863
00:55:23,490 --> 00:55:25,425
- Nobody else.
- Nobody else...

864
00:55:25,458 --> 00:55:28,529
- Cornbread, enough with the bullshit!
- No!

865
00:55:28,563 --> 00:55:29,697
Get out of here.

866
00:55:29,730 --> 00:55:32,533
Mr. Chamberlain.

867
00:55:43,443 --> 00:55:45,478
- Hello.
- <i>Pop, it's Junior.</i>

868
00:55:45,513 --> 00:55:47,447
<i>What's going on,
did Tonyia come down?</i>

869
00:55:48,549 --> 00:55:50,084
I... I don't know.

870
00:55:50,117 --> 00:55:53,554
They're still trying to bust
into my apartment.

871
00:55:53,588 --> 00:55:56,958
They are... They are
outside my room.

872
00:55:56,991 --> 00:55:59,560
They are outside my windows
harassing me.

873
00:55:59,594 --> 00:56:03,396
They broke my damn door
with a fireman's ax.

874
00:56:03,430 --> 00:56:05,700
<i>What? Pa,
I'm coming down there.</i>

875
00:56:05,733 --> 00:56:07,500
No, no, no, no!

876
00:56:07,535 --> 00:56:10,605
You stay put.
It's too dangerous down here.

877
00:56:10,638 --> 00:56:11,906
<i>I'm leaving right now.</i>

878
00:56:11,939 --> 00:56:13,007
I said no!

879
00:56:15,442 --> 00:56:16,476
<i>Pa...</i>

880
00:56:18,512 --> 00:56:20,915
<i>I just don't want
this to be another...</i>

881
00:56:20,948 --> 00:56:23,084
<i>You know what happened
last year.</i>

882
00:56:24,085 --> 00:56:25,152
<i>Okay.</i>

883
00:56:26,153 --> 00:56:28,823
All right. I know.

884
00:56:31,826 --> 00:56:35,796
Junior, I gotta go.
I'll call you when they gone.

885
00:56:35,830 --> 00:56:37,198
<i>No, Pop, I'm heading
down there now.</i>

886
00:56:37,231 --> 00:56:40,701
No, no, no, I'm fine,
Junior. I love you.

887
00:56:40,735 --> 00:56:42,570
<i>Love you too.</i>

888
00:56:42,603 --> 00:56:45,072
<i>Dad, hold on.
I'll see you soon.</i>

889
00:56:45,506 --> 00:56:46,707
Junior!

890
00:56:47,575 --> 00:56:49,877
Junior! Junior!

891
00:56:50,611 --> 00:56:51,646
Junior!

892
00:57:40,528 --> 00:57:41,562
Fuck!

893
00:58:18,866 --> 00:58:21,302
So, Sarge is gonna cut the
slap lock with bolt cutters,

894
00:58:21,335 --> 00:58:23,170
and we're going to
push that door open.

895
00:58:23,204 --> 00:58:24,405
He's got a...
He's got a...

896
00:58:24,438 --> 00:58:28,075
chair or something in the
entryway, blocking the doorway.

897
00:58:28,109 --> 00:58:31,145
Once we get the lock, if we have to,
we'll take the door off the hinges.

898
00:58:35,082 --> 00:58:37,551
Now once that door is open,
Evans, take the shield.

899
00:58:37,585 --> 00:58:38,886
Jackson, you cover.

900
00:58:38,919 --> 00:58:41,889
I'll take the bags
and communicate, all right?

901
00:58:41,922 --> 00:58:44,692
Okay, let's show this Angus,
who's boss.

902
00:58:45,893 --> 00:58:47,828
Rossi, get these
people out of here.

903
00:59:03,911 --> 00:59:05,713
Officer,
officer, please.

904
00:59:05,746 --> 00:59:07,281
I'm Kenny's niece.
Please let me talk to him.

905
00:59:07,314 --> 00:59:09,750
I could help you.

906
00:59:09,784 --> 00:59:11,152
Officer, please,
I'm telling you,

907
00:59:11,185 --> 00:59:12,319
I can help you if you
let me talk to him.

908
00:59:12,353 --> 00:59:14,889
Hey, we don't got time
to play these games, all right?

909
00:59:14,922 --> 00:59:17,158
You all need to
get out of the hallway.

910
00:59:17,191 --> 00:59:18,292
I'm telling you,
I can...

911
00:59:18,325 --> 00:59:20,795
Ma'am, stay back
and let us do our job.

912
00:59:20,828 --> 00:59:22,196
Handle this.

913
00:59:22,229 --> 00:59:24,198
Evans, come here.

914
00:59:24,231 --> 00:59:26,067
Someone should call 911.

915
00:59:26,100 --> 00:59:27,835
Tell them what's going on.

916
00:59:45,686 --> 00:59:47,755
All right. Okay.

917
00:59:49,023 --> 00:59:50,091
Okay.

918
00:59:50,124 --> 00:59:51,092
No!

919
00:59:51,125 --> 00:59:53,360
Kenneth,
this is on you, buddy.

920
00:59:53,394 --> 00:59:55,262
Do not cut that lock!

921
00:59:55,296 --> 00:59:56,630
Go!

922
00:59:56,664 --> 00:59:58,032
Put the knife down, sir!

923
00:59:58,065 --> 01:00:00,768
Put the goddamn knife
down, Kenneth!

924
01:00:00,801 --> 01:00:04,205
Not until you leave!

925
01:00:04,238 --> 01:00:06,640
It's for your own
good, my friend!

926
01:00:06,674 --> 01:00:08,242
Watch out! Watch out!

927
01:00:08,275 --> 01:00:10,010
Kenneth, get away
from the door

928
01:00:10,044 --> 01:00:12,012
and put the goddamn
knife down!

929
01:00:12,046 --> 01:00:15,182
I... I do not want you here.

930
01:00:15,216 --> 01:00:17,384
I have done nothing.
You have no warrant,

931
01:00:17,418 --> 01:00:19,286
you have no legal cause,

932
01:00:19,320 --> 01:00:22,723
and you illegally
broke my door!

933
01:00:22,756 --> 01:00:23,958
Oh! Watch out.
Watch out. Watch out.

934
01:00:23,991 --> 01:00:25,359
Kenneth, come on!

935
01:00:25,392 --> 01:00:27,228
I do not want you
inside my apartment!

936
01:00:27,261 --> 01:00:30,264
Sir, I'm begging you,
I am begging you, please!

937
01:00:30,297 --> 01:00:31,866
Please! Just let me
talk to him,

938
01:00:31,899 --> 01:00:33,234
my uncle can't handle this.

939
01:00:33,267 --> 01:00:35,870
He has a heart condition,
and he didn't do anything!

940
01:00:35,903 --> 01:00:38,772
He... he don't have
no emergency!

941
01:00:39,974 --> 01:00:42,676
What did he do
to deserve all this?

942
01:00:42,710 --> 01:00:46,413
Please, please,
just let me talk to him.

943
01:00:46,447 --> 01:00:48,382
Maybe, maybe he'll open
the door for me.

944
01:00:50,918 --> 01:00:53,387
Hold on, okay?

945
01:00:55,055 --> 01:00:56,790
Chamberlain's niece
is right over there,

946
01:00:56,824 --> 01:00:58,359
she's begging for her
to speak to him.

947
01:00:58,392 --> 01:01:00,761
Tonya! Oh, God, help me!

948
01:01:00,794 --> 01:01:02,329
Help me, Tonya!

949
01:01:02,363 --> 01:01:03,598
What for?
So they can sing kumbaya?

950
01:01:03,632 --> 01:01:06,000
- Not gonna happen.
- He's not gonna open the door for us.

951
01:01:06,033 --> 01:01:08,002
- He will never open the door for us!
- Hey!

952
01:01:08,035 --> 01:01:09,470
Maybe he'll open
the door for her!

953
01:01:09,503 --> 01:01:12,039
Hey! Hey! Stand down! Look at me!

954
01:01:12,072 --> 01:01:14,175
We're not playing
these games anymore.

955
01:01:14,208 --> 01:01:16,744
He's been jerking us around
for almost an hour now.

956
01:01:16,777 --> 01:01:18,445
And you lost your chance

957
01:01:18,479 --> 01:01:20,114
to contribute
to this operation

958
01:01:20,147 --> 01:01:22,883
when you decided to question
your Sergeant's authority.

959
01:01:22,917 --> 01:01:25,786
Now, you get her out of here.

960
01:01:40,935 --> 01:01:42,970
I'm sorry. We're gonna have to
clear this area, please.

961
01:01:43,003 --> 01:01:44,271
Wait, wait a minute.

962
01:01:45,472 --> 01:01:47,341
- Are they...
- Please.

963
01:01:47,374 --> 01:01:49,143
- Slam it.
- Slam it.

964
01:01:49,176 --> 01:01:50,444
- Get it.
- Come on.

965
01:01:54,181 --> 01:01:57,151
Get it!

966
01:01:58,152 --> 01:01:59,420
Yeah!

967
01:01:59,453 --> 01:02:01,422
- Stop it. Stop it.
- <i>Mr. Chamberlain?</i>

968
01:02:01,455 --> 01:02:03,123
It's not coming.

969
01:02:03,157 --> 01:02:05,025
Stop it. Stop it.

970
01:02:06,860 --> 01:02:08,729
- Knife! Knife! Knife!
- <i>Talk to me!</i>

971
01:02:11,799 --> 01:02:13,067
Knife! Knife! Knife!

972
01:02:13,100 --> 01:02:14,368
No! No!

973
01:02:19,440 --> 01:02:20,975
Got it!

974
01:02:21,008 --> 01:02:22,109
All right!

975
01:02:22,142 --> 01:02:23,277
Get the knife!
Get the knife!

976
01:02:23,310 --> 01:02:25,513
<i>Talk to me, please.
What's happening?</i>

977
01:02:25,547 --> 01:02:27,314
Get out! Get out!

978
01:02:29,183 --> 01:02:30,384
You broke my lock!

979
01:02:30,417 --> 01:02:32,386
Oh!

980
01:02:32,419 --> 01:02:33,521
<i>Mr. Chamberlain?</i>

981
01:02:33,555 --> 01:02:37,291
Fear not,
for God gave us a spirit

982
01:02:37,324 --> 01:02:39,927
not of fear,
but of power and love...

983
01:02:39,960 --> 01:02:42,229
Stop making a mess, Kenneth.
You're doing this to yourself!

984
01:02:42,263 --> 01:02:45,099
...and self-control.
He's always with us.

985
01:02:47,401 --> 01:02:48,802
He renews my strength.

986
01:02:55,610 --> 01:03:00,414
<i>Mr. Chamberlain? Hello?</i>

987
01:03:00,447 --> 01:03:02,349
Uh, he's got
something blocking the door!

988
01:03:02,383 --> 01:03:03,984
We're gonna have to
get those hinges off!

989
01:03:05,419 --> 01:03:08,188
No, no.

990
01:03:10,224 --> 01:03:11,593
All right.
I got the sledge. I got it.

991
01:03:11,626 --> 01:03:12,661
- Oh...
- <i>Sir?</i>

992
01:03:12,694 --> 01:03:16,330
Even though I walk through
the darkest valley.

993
01:03:16,363 --> 01:03:18,432
I will not be afraid,
for you are close beside me.

994
01:03:18,465 --> 01:03:20,501
Your rod and your staff
protect and comfort me...

995
01:03:25,372 --> 01:03:27,074
<i>Mr. Chamberlain,
please...</i>

996
01:03:33,113 --> 01:03:37,318
- <i>I can't leave until you pick up, sir, please!</i>
- No, no, no!

997
01:03:37,351 --> 01:03:39,486
Do not break down my door!

998
01:03:40,655 --> 01:03:43,591
This is on you, buddy.
It's your choice!

999
01:03:43,625 --> 01:03:46,226
- <i>Mr. Chamberlain...</i>
- Don't you take my door off!

1000
01:03:49,631 --> 01:03:51,131
No! Oh!

1001
01:03:51,165 --> 01:03:52,534
<i>Please, Mr. Chamberlain!</i>

1002
01:03:52,567 --> 01:03:56,036
It's over, Mr. Chamberlain!
It's over!

1003
01:03:56,070 --> 01:03:58,372
Goddamn it, leave me alone!

1004
01:03:58,405 --> 01:04:02,076
Stop! Stop it!
Don't you take my door off!

1005
01:04:02,109 --> 01:04:05,613
911. Here. Talk to the police. Here, take it.

1006
01:04:05,647 --> 01:04:09,416
Yeah. Hello,
I'm at 135 South Lexington,

1007
01:04:09,450 --> 01:04:11,185
um, White Plains, New York.

1008
01:04:12,353 --> 01:04:14,021
The police are trying
to break down my uncle's door!

1009
01:04:14,054 --> 01:04:15,523
<i>Sorry, what was the address?</i>

1010
01:04:15,557 --> 01:04:18,892
Yes, 1-3-5 South Lexington!

1011
01:04:18,926 --> 01:04:19,993
<i>Sorry, ma'am...</i>

1012
01:04:20,027 --> 01:04:22,229
I know they're already here.
Can you send somebody?

1013
01:04:22,262 --> 01:04:24,131
- <i>Ma'am...</i>
- Please!

1014
01:04:24,164 --> 01:04:26,033
He didn't do anything.
They are harassing him!

1015
01:04:27,267 --> 01:04:28,670
He didn't do anything!

1016
01:04:28,703 --> 01:04:31,573
- Leave me alone!
- <i>I see him! Get him!</i>

1017
01:04:35,142 --> 01:04:37,978
<i>Sir?
I need you to pick up.</i>

1018
01:04:38,011 --> 01:04:42,149
No. No, no... my...

1019
01:04:42,182 --> 01:04:45,419
<i>Hello?
Mr. Chamberlain?</i>

1020
01:04:45,452 --> 01:04:47,622
Hello, President Obama.

1021
01:04:47,655 --> 01:04:48,889
<i>What?</i>

1022
01:04:48,922 --> 01:04:51,325
- Try the bottom one.
- Get it. I got it.

1023
01:04:51,358 --> 01:04:55,697
This is Kenneth Chamberlain.
President Obama!

1024
01:04:57,231 --> 01:04:59,433
- The police have broken down my door...
- <i>Mr. Chamberlain,</i>

1025
01:04:59,466 --> 01:05:01,969
- w <i>hat's going on?</i>
- Without probable cause, without a warrant!

1026
01:05:02,002 --> 01:05:04,004
Please help me!

1027
01:05:06,407 --> 01:05:08,142
<i>Please try
to stay calm.</i>

1028
01:05:10,277 --> 01:05:12,446
Stop fighting us,
Mr. Chamberlain!

1029
01:05:12,479 --> 01:05:14,516
You are being recorded.

1030
01:05:14,549 --> 01:05:17,217
Your actions,
they will be remembered!

1031
01:05:17,251 --> 01:05:19,386
Sarge, take a break,
get out of there!

1032
01:05:19,420 --> 01:05:20,722
This is a crime!

1033
01:05:20,755 --> 01:05:24,391
I don't give a fuck,
you fucking nigger!

1034
01:05:25,993 --> 01:05:26,861
<i>What is that?</i>

1035
01:05:26,895 --> 01:05:28,696
Hey!
What did you just say now?

1036
01:05:28,730 --> 01:05:30,532
What the fuck did you just say?

1037
01:05:30,565 --> 01:05:32,332
What's the fuck
is wrong with you, man?

1038
01:05:32,366 --> 01:05:34,968
- Come on! Let's act like adults!
- What's wrong with you?

1039
01:05:35,002 --> 01:05:36,738
Calm down!

1040
01:05:36,771 --> 01:05:39,707
I am 70 years old,
I have a bad heart.

1041
01:05:41,208 --> 01:05:42,976
You say that shit
one more time. Okay?

1042
01:05:43,010 --> 01:05:44,311
- Okay.
- Just, say it again!

1043
01:05:44,344 --> 01:05:45,946
All right. All right.

1044
01:05:45,979 --> 01:05:49,216
- <i>Hello!</i>
- This is my sworn testimony for the Department of Justice.

1045
01:05:49,249 --> 01:05:50,451
<i>Do you hear me, sir?</i>

1046
01:05:50,484 --> 01:05:52,219
What the hell
is the matter with you?

1047
01:05:52,252 --> 01:05:54,188
I'm trying to get in that
goddamn door!

1048
01:05:54,221 --> 01:05:56,056
Who the hell
do you think you are?

1049
01:05:56,089 --> 01:05:57,525
You're getting a 5-80.

1050
01:05:57,559 --> 01:06:00,060
- Act like a fucking police officer!
- Okay.

1051
01:06:00,093 --> 01:06:01,395
Calm down.

1052
01:06:01,428 --> 01:06:05,966
Without a warrant,
without probable cause!

1053
01:06:17,110 --> 01:06:19,012
This is my home...

1054
01:06:19,046 --> 01:06:20,180
Shut up!

1055
01:06:21,448 --> 01:06:22,650
Take the shield.

1056
01:06:22,684 --> 01:06:25,185
What's fucking wrong with you?

1057
01:06:25,219 --> 01:06:29,591
You are being recorded.
Your actions will be remembered!

1058
01:06:33,728 --> 01:06:35,630
<i>Sir! Please pick up.</i>

1059
01:06:36,831 --> 01:06:41,134
Now lock it up, and let's act
like police officers, now!

1060
01:06:45,607 --> 01:06:46,774
Are you ready to do this?

1061
01:06:48,643 --> 01:06:51,411
- Open up the fucking door.
- On my count.

1062
01:06:56,718 --> 01:06:58,352
One...

1063
01:07:00,153 --> 01:07:01,255
Two...

1064
01:07:04,091 --> 01:07:05,492
Three!

1065
01:07:07,862 --> 01:07:09,731
No! Oh!

1066
01:07:09,764 --> 01:07:11,833
<i>Hello? What is going on?</i>

1067
01:07:11,866 --> 01:07:14,134
Go, go,
push, push, push!

1068
01:07:16,638 --> 01:07:18,540
<i>Mr. Chamberlain,
can you hear me?</i>

1069
01:07:18,573 --> 01:07:20,340
<i>Are you okay?</i>

1070
01:07:20,374 --> 01:07:22,010
Leave me alone!

1071
01:07:22,042 --> 01:07:24,779
<i>Just tell me what's goin' on. Mr. Chamberlain.</i>

1072
01:07:24,812 --> 01:07:26,146
<i>Please talk to me!</i>

1073
01:07:27,715 --> 01:07:28,816
- This ain't right.
- Back up.

1074
01:07:28,850 --> 01:07:30,350
Just let me...

1075
01:07:30,384 --> 01:07:33,521
- <i>Please tell me what's happening.</i>
- Leave me alone!

1076
01:07:33,555 --> 01:07:37,324
<i>Sir? Mr. Chamberlain,
what's going on?</i>

1077
01:07:37,357 --> 01:07:39,861
The police
have broken down my door.

1078
01:07:39,894 --> 01:07:41,829
They're in my apartment!

1079
01:07:41,863 --> 01:07:45,399
Now they're coming at me
with tasers and shotguns.

1080
01:07:45,432 --> 01:07:48,670
Drop any weapons you
have, and lay still on the ground!

1081
01:07:48,703 --> 01:07:51,138
Leave me alone!

1082
01:07:51,171 --> 01:07:52,874
Just listen to us, Kenneth!

1083
01:07:56,611 --> 01:07:59,413
Mr. Chamberlain,
we're not gonna hurt you.

1084
01:07:59,446 --> 01:08:00,715
Leave!

1085
01:08:00,748 --> 01:08:02,850
We don't want to do this,
Mr. Chamberlain!

1086
01:08:02,884 --> 01:08:04,686
Just listen to us!

1087
01:08:04,719 --> 01:08:06,386
Lord, I trust in you.

1088
01:08:06,420 --> 01:08:09,356
<i>Just follow their instructions,
Mr. Chamberlain. Just do what they say!</i>

1089
01:08:09,389 --> 01:08:12,426
- <i>Just do what they say!</i>
- Never let me be disrespected...

1090
01:08:12,459 --> 01:08:14,361
We don't wanna do this!

1091
01:08:14,394 --> 01:08:17,464
Give me your strength
and give me your protection...

1092
01:08:19,534 --> 01:08:21,101
Save me.

1093
01:08:21,134 --> 01:08:23,705
- <i>Mr. Chamberlain, just do what</i> they say!
- Save me.

1094
01:08:23,738 --> 01:08:24,839
Leave!

1095
01:08:26,708 --> 01:08:28,342
- Hit it!
- <i>Hello.</i>

1096
01:08:31,211 --> 01:08:32,245
Grab him.

1097
01:08:34,649 --> 01:08:35,883
<i>Mr. Chamberlain,
please talk to me.</i>

1098
01:08:38,620 --> 01:08:40,655
Mr. Chamberlain?

1099
01:08:40,688 --> 01:08:43,758
Oh, Lord, have mercy,
because I am in misery.

1100
01:08:45,927 --> 01:08:47,695
Stay down!

1101
01:08:52,900 --> 01:08:54,736
All right, all right.
Now, everybody, just stop!

1102
01:08:56,838 --> 01:08:58,840
All right, this is over.

1103
01:08:58,873 --> 01:09:01,475
You're not fucking listening!

1104
01:09:06,514 --> 01:09:08,650
Oh, my God!

1105
01:09:09,884 --> 01:09:11,385
<i>Don't do anything!</i>

1106
01:09:12,553 --> 01:09:13,554
Get his arms!

1107
01:09:14,421 --> 01:09:16,390
My eyes are weak...

1108
01:09:20,227 --> 01:09:21,863
Put your ass down, cornbread.

1109
01:09:24,565 --> 01:09:25,633
Stop fighting!

1110
01:09:25,667 --> 01:09:29,403
I'm using up
my strength.

1111
01:09:30,772 --> 01:09:31,906
Get off of him. This is over.

1112
01:09:32,774 --> 01:09:34,441
Get off me!

1113
01:09:34,474 --> 01:09:36,944
Kenny, I'm over here!

1114
01:09:36,978 --> 01:09:39,714
I cannot breathe!

1115
01:09:39,747 --> 01:09:42,282
Mr. Chamberlain, stay down,
before you get hurt.

1116
01:09:42,315 --> 01:09:44,585
Get off me!

1117
01:09:44,619 --> 01:09:45,720
All right!

1118
01:09:59,033 --> 01:10:00,601
What are you doing?

1119
01:10:03,604 --> 01:10:05,606
Ahh! I can't breathe! Stop!

1120
01:10:05,640 --> 01:10:07,374
<i>Mr. Chamberlain,
are you okay?</i>

1121
01:10:12,914 --> 01:10:16,249
No! Stop! Stop!

1122
01:11:21,381 --> 01:11:23,450
<i>I tell people,
good, bad, or indifferent,</i>

1123
01:11:23,483 --> 01:11:25,853
<i>my father loved me.
I loved him.</i>

1124
01:11:25,887 --> 01:11:29,090
<i>I did plenty of things
that he didn't agree with,</i>

1125
01:11:29,123 --> 01:11:31,092
<i>that he would really
get on me about.</i>

1126
01:11:31,125 --> 01:11:33,493
<i>But one thing
that I can always say is</i>

1127
01:11:33,528 --> 01:11:34,996
<i>that no matter
what I went through,</i>

1128
01:11:35,029 --> 01:11:37,932
<i>my father supported me.
He encouraged me.</i>

1129
01:11:37,965 --> 01:11:39,867
He let me find my way.

1130
01:11:39,901 --> 01:11:43,436
<i>This is your help center for Life Aid.</i>

1131
01:11:43,470 --> 01:11:45,706
<i>Kenneth, do you need help?</i>

1132
01:11:45,740 --> 01:11:48,475
<i>Mr. Chamberlain,
you pressed your medical button.</i>

1133
01:11:48,509 --> 01:11:49,911
<i>Do you need help?</i>

1134
01:11:49,944 --> 01:11:52,412
<i>Mr. Chamberlain,
I'm not getting a response.</i>

1135
01:11:52,445 --> 01:11:55,683
<i>I'm going to notify someone
to come by and help you now.</i>

1136
01:11:57,618 --> 01:11:59,120
<i>White Plains Police Office.</i>

1137
01:12:05,693 --> 01:12:08,395
<i>This is your
help center for Life Aid.</i>

1138
01:12:08,428 --> 01:12:10,463
<i>Mr. Chamberlain,
do you need help?</i>

1139
01:12:10,497 --> 01:12:12,533
<i>Yes. It's an emergency.</i>

1140
01:12:12,567 --> 01:12:14,467
<i>I have the White Plains
Police Department,</i>

1141
01:12:14,501 --> 01:12:16,070
<i>banging on my door.</i>

1142
01:12:16,103 --> 01:12:19,740
<i>I did not call them,
and I am not sick!</i>

1143
01:12:46,433 --> 01:12:47,702
<i>You're going to kill me, huh?</i>

1144
01:12:47,735 --> 01:12:49,770
<i>You're gonna beat
my fucking ass.</i>

1145
01:12:49,804 --> 01:12:53,040
<i>Leave me alone.
I didn't call anybody.</i>

1146
01:12:53,074 --> 01:12:54,441
<i>Now leave!</i>

1147
01:12:54,474 --> 01:12:56,911
<i>Oh!</i>

1148
01:12:56,944 --> 01:13:00,948
<i>Oh, they have shotguns, y'all.</i>

1149
01:13:00,982 --> 01:13:03,918
<i>They have stun guns
and shotguns.</i>

1150
01:13:06,587 --> 01:13:08,089
<i>They're planning on taking me</i>

1151
01:13:08,122 --> 01:13:11,458
<i>to the White Plains
Police Department and beat me.</i>

1152
01:13:11,491 --> 01:13:12,793
<i>And then kill me.</i>

1153
01:13:23,771 --> 01:13:25,172
<i>Don't do that, sir.</i>

1154
01:13:25,206 --> 01:13:27,708
<i>Don't do that.
Don't do that, officer.</i>

1155
01:13:27,742 --> 01:13:31,012
<i>Don't do that. Don't do that.
Don't do that.</i>
