1
00:00:34,239 --> 00:00:36,253
Can I hold him?

2
00:00:36,277 --> 00:00:37,970
Will you put him on me?

3
00:00:43,248 --> 00:00:44,766
I want to put it on me.

4
00:00:44,790 --> 00:00:47,561
- Can you put it on me?
- Just wait, guys.

5
00:00:49,075 --> 00:00:50,817
Gentle.

6
00:00:52,757 --> 00:00:54,526
Be very careful.

7
00:00:54,550 --> 00:00:56,570
Close your eyeballs, close your eyeballs.

8
00:00:56,594 --> 00:01:00,116
My God, I think it likes you...a lot.

9
00:01:00,140 --> 00:01:02,284
Oh, my gosh, it's gonna climb on your eye!

10
00:01:02,308 --> 00:01:04,786
You okay? You okay?

11
00:01:04,810 --> 00:01:05,829
You're good?

12
00:01:05,853 --> 00:01:07,373
Get it off her.

13
00:01:07,397 --> 00:01:09,295
Don't scare him. Don't scare him.

14
00:01:10,319 --> 00:01:12,556
Did that butterfly just come?

15
00:01:12,580 --> 00:01:14,556
Shh. Go on, buddy.

16
00:01:17,165 --> 00:01:18,907
You got him!

17
00:01:22,537 --> 00:01:24,180
Oh, no!

18
00:01:25,581 --> 00:01:28,301
So your whole hotel room
is a clear plastic bubble.

19
00:01:28,325 --> 00:01:30,062
It's heated, it's everything...

20
00:01:30,086 --> 00:01:31,538
Damn.

21
00:01:50,606 --> 00:01:52,641
Help.

22
00:01:52,665 --> 00:01:54,909
You look as beautiful
as the day I met you.

23
00:01:57,213 --> 00:01:59,948
Even more, even more beautiful.

24
00:02:10,768 --> 00:02:12,598
Don't forget to tie your shoelace.

25
00:02:13,629 --> 00:02:16,320
Oh, I have your truck, Isaiah.

26
00:02:16,344 --> 00:02:18,761
- Thank you.
- Okay.

27
00:02:18,785 --> 00:02:20,844
Good night. Have a good night.

28
00:02:24,048 --> 00:02:27,334
I'm going to the park.
My dad is very late.

29
00:02:27,358 --> 00:02:31,736
- Came we come?
- No, your parents are here.

30
00:02:31,760 --> 00:02:36,007
Daycare is closed. See you, guys.
Goodnight.

31
00:02:38,176 --> 00:02:41,048
You are about to jump.
I haven't given them insurance.

32
00:02:41,072 --> 00:02:43,428
Well we signed off all
of our rights already.

33
00:02:43,452 --> 00:02:49,929
All you have to do to not
break your legs is lift them up.

34
00:02:49,953 --> 00:02:52,503
Oh, my God.

35
00:02:52,527 --> 00:02:55,015
You are soaking wet.

36
00:03:06,262 --> 00:03:07,769
Oliver.

37
00:03:14,990 --> 00:03:17,805
Like one minute now.

38
00:03:26,161 --> 00:03:27,638
Put your goggles down.

39
00:03:27,662 --> 00:03:29,098
Here we go!

40
00:03:30,223 --> 00:03:32,212
There's that fear!

41
00:03:33,876 --> 00:03:38,019
Okay. Fuck.

42
00:03:38,043 --> 00:03:40,742
You're just swimming in your clothes?

43
00:03:40,766 --> 00:03:43,474
- I can give him...
- What is that?

44
00:03:43,498 --> 00:03:45,906
It's my shirt. It's pretty dry still.

45
00:03:46,952 --> 00:03:49,388
Come here. Up.

46
00:03:49,412 --> 00:03:52,360
Alright, get your stuff. Thank you.

47
00:04:13,970 --> 00:04:16,453
I want you all to imagine this plane.

48
00:04:16,477 --> 00:04:17,896
This tiny, tiny plane.

49
00:04:17,920 --> 00:04:22,563
I want everyone to think about
a slight rumbling of the ground.

50
00:04:22,587 --> 00:04:24,108
You're just...

51
00:04:34,687 --> 00:04:36,952
Come on back to us.

52
00:04:42,445 --> 00:04:44,522
Oh, there, you're back.

53
00:04:46,445 --> 00:04:48,161
And...

54
00:04:48,185 --> 00:04:51,573
You feel the lift off the ground.

55
00:04:51,597 --> 00:04:55,781
And you feel the plane climbing,
and climbing

56
00:04:55,805 --> 00:04:58,033
and climbing into the sky.

57
00:04:58,057 --> 00:04:59,128
Sarah.

58
00:04:59,152 --> 00:05:02,454
<i>Whoosh, the door to the plane is open</i>

59
00:05:02,478 --> 00:05:04,478
and you're just hearing
all this rushing air.

60
00:05:04,502 --> 00:05:09,679
You just hear, "Shh."

61
00:05:09,703 --> 00:05:12,390
And then they pull the parachute
and it goes,

62
00:05:14,819 --> 00:05:16,860
Ya! Ya! Ya!

63
00:05:27,240 --> 00:05:28,467
Oh, my God.

64
00:05:30,410 --> 00:05:33,875
We have a better for than you, boys.

65
00:05:33,899 --> 00:05:36,349
- We don't care.
- Yes, you do.

66
00:05:36,373 --> 00:05:39,022
What's the password?

67
00:05:39,046 --> 00:05:40,899
What's happening under here?

68
00:05:42,346 --> 00:05:44,176
We're just taking a mermaid nap.

69
00:05:44,200 --> 00:05:45,858
A mermaid nap.

70
00:05:45,882 --> 00:05:47,861
And mermaid bubbles.

71
00:05:47,885 --> 00:05:52,339
You know what? You have to be up, okay?
You have to be eyes on the room.

72
00:05:52,363 --> 00:05:54,425
Can you please get out of there?

73
00:06:01,918 --> 00:06:03,952
Anne. Anne?

74
00:06:05,152 --> 00:06:07,702
We gotta be role models
for these guys, okay?

75
00:06:07,726 --> 00:06:09,459
- I'm playing with them.
- No, I know, I get that.

76
00:06:09,483 --> 00:06:12,984
I just want you to know that I need
you on the floor, eyes on, okay?

77
00:06:13,008 --> 00:06:17,329
You have to be able to do the job
at the same time. Okay?

78
00:06:38,852 --> 00:06:41,418
So don't be weird.

79
00:06:41,442 --> 00:06:44,228
- Don't be weird?
- There's just some drawings on the walls.

80
00:06:46,350 --> 00:06:48,200
Drawings.

81
00:06:50,199 --> 00:06:55,358
The guy in apartment 3 did all of this.

82
00:06:55,382 --> 00:06:57,931
And the landlord got really pissed off

83
00:06:57,955 --> 00:07:00,110
and the guy was like,

84
00:07:00,134 --> 00:07:02,161
"I don't know,
I think I made it look better,"

85
00:07:02,185 --> 00:07:03,425
and the landlord was just like,

86
00:07:03,449 --> 00:07:05,539
"You just drew a bunch
of dicks on the walls.

87
00:07:05,563 --> 00:07:07,793
How did you make it look better?"

88
00:07:07,817 --> 00:07:09,414
But like,

89
00:07:09,438 --> 00:07:12,541
then he didn't do anything about it so...

90
00:07:18,676 --> 00:07:20,078
So what do you think?

91
00:07:20,102 --> 00:07:21,350
I think it's nice.

92
00:07:23,033 --> 00:07:26,001
The floors are fine.

93
00:07:26,025 --> 00:07:27,336
Counter's good. Yeah.

94
00:07:27,360 --> 00:07:29,080
Stove's good.

95
00:07:30,844 --> 00:07:33,041
You're warm?

96
00:07:33,065 --> 00:07:34,698
- Okay.
- Yeah.

97
00:07:34,722 --> 00:07:39,723
And the landlord said
that he can put in an air condition unit.

98
00:07:39,747 --> 00:07:41,792
Oh, good.

99
00:07:41,816 --> 00:07:43,553
Yeah, that'll be great.

100
00:07:46,504 --> 00:07:47,690
You feeling okay?

101
00:07:47,714 --> 00:07:50,008
Yeah, I feel great. Yeah.

102
00:07:53,404 --> 00:07:55,460
How's work and stuff?

103
00:07:56,750 --> 00:07:59,077
Yeah, no, it's good.

104
00:07:59,101 --> 00:08:02,060
It's like a little bit tiring but...

105
00:08:02,084 --> 00:08:06,792
I think I'll get used to it,
used to doing the four shifts a week.

106
00:08:06,816 --> 00:08:10,403
I just want to get the house really nice

107
00:08:10,427 --> 00:08:12,291
so that I can have people over.

108
00:08:12,315 --> 00:08:14,705
- Have you had people over?
- No.

109
00:08:17,769 --> 00:08:19,721
Except for me.

110
00:08:19,745 --> 00:08:21,191
Right.

111
00:08:21,215 --> 00:08:22,974
I feel honoured.

112
00:08:22,998 --> 00:08:25,464
Mums don't count.

113
00:08:25,488 --> 00:08:27,049
Yeah, I know.

114
00:08:28,876 --> 00:08:31,064
No, it looks good. Really good.

115
00:08:48,356 --> 00:08:52,024
I am drawing a fairy with curly hair.

116
00:08:53,696 --> 00:08:56,110
- Can I keep the picture?
- Yeah.

117
00:08:56,134 --> 00:08:57,801
Who wants to give her another eyeball?

118
00:08:57,825 --> 00:09:01,014
- I want to.
- No, remember when she said...

119
00:09:01,038 --> 00:09:03,266
Parmis and I do some too.

120
00:09:04,604 --> 00:09:06,846
It's fine.

121
00:09:06,870 --> 00:09:09,869
It's fine.
Do you want to turn it into a boat?

122
00:09:09,893 --> 00:09:11,227
No.

123
00:09:12,706 --> 00:09:15,265
Look, you just turn it into a boat, look.

124
00:09:16,469 --> 00:09:19,662
- Can I make some wild curls?
- Yeah, of course you can.

125
00:09:19,686 --> 00:09:22,074
She can have curls for days.

126
00:09:22,098 --> 00:09:24,202
Lunchtime!

127
00:09:24,226 --> 00:09:26,506
- Who has washed their hands?
- I did!

128
00:09:26,530 --> 00:09:29,689
Do you guys want to come
with me to wash your hands?

129
00:09:29,713 --> 00:09:32,165
Have you washed your hands yet?

130
00:09:36,047 --> 00:09:38,998
Hey Sophia,
why don't you come sit at this table?

131
00:09:39,022 --> 00:09:41,005
There's still spots over here.

132
00:09:44,997 --> 00:09:47,267
So as you know,
I came around this last week

133
00:09:47,291 --> 00:09:49,436
and got everybody to sign
the new support plans

134
00:09:49,460 --> 00:09:51,396
and at the moment
we have a couple of children

135
00:09:51,420 --> 00:09:53,996
that are especially challenging.

136
00:09:54,020 --> 00:09:58,039
I do want to stress that I've had a couple
of the parents come forward to me

137
00:09:58,063 --> 00:10:01,474
and they're concerned that the staff
aren't being that supportive.

138
00:10:01,498 --> 00:10:05,114
And what our role is,
from the city point of view,

139
00:10:05,138 --> 00:10:06,819
is that we have to try everything.

140
00:10:06,843 --> 00:10:11,959
That means that if we need extra support
we try and get extra staff in

141
00:10:11,983 --> 00:10:13,877
or we try and do extra training.

142
00:10:13,901 --> 00:10:17,225
I know it's hard,
but we've got to work together,

143
00:10:17,249 --> 00:10:20,061
otherwise we could
have a human rights issue.

144
00:10:20,085 --> 00:10:24,304
That would be awful
for the centre and the families.

145
00:10:24,328 --> 00:10:26,934
Does anybody have any questions?

146
00:10:26,958 --> 00:10:29,383
You know, I'm feeling really drained

147
00:10:29,407 --> 00:10:34,093
because for instance last week
I was doing snack with seven kids

148
00:10:34,117 --> 00:10:37,092
and I get punched
in the centre of by back.

149
00:10:37,116 --> 00:10:40,087
My natural reaction would be like,
"What the hell is going on?"

150
00:10:40,111 --> 00:10:45,075
but I have to be like,
"Oh, please don't do that."

151
00:10:45,099 --> 00:10:50,798
I really don't feel like it's fair
that the city is putting this on us

152
00:10:50,822 --> 00:10:54,771
to be able to deal with it
and I feel like they have a mandate

153
00:10:54,795 --> 00:10:58,964
and this is what it is
and we really don't have a voice.

154
00:10:58,988 --> 00:11:00,465
I know it's hard Asina

155
00:11:00,489 --> 00:11:04,970
but we need to think of,
instead of the child misbehaving

156
00:11:04,994 --> 00:11:06,722
they're stressed.

157
00:11:06,746 --> 00:11:08,098
They're not handling

158
00:11:08,122 --> 00:11:11,727
so that's our role.

159
00:11:11,751 --> 00:11:16,064
I mean I don't care if a
kid is climbing all over me

160
00:11:16,088 --> 00:11:18,024
or pulling my hair or something.

161
00:11:18,048 --> 00:11:19,735
But what I have a problem with

162
00:11:19,759 --> 00:11:22,440
is when there are different teachers

163
00:11:22,464 --> 00:11:25,228
that are really judgmental
of the way you're dealing with a kid.

164
00:11:25,252 --> 00:11:27,817
Yeah but some of us
have a lot more experience

165
00:11:27,841 --> 00:11:30,881
and can see what's happening is not right.

166
00:11:31,967 --> 00:11:35,125
Some of the teacher aren't
trying to gently guide others

167
00:11:35,149 --> 00:11:39,202
- they're like...
- Yeah, we actually are.

168
00:11:39,226 --> 00:11:44,509
Well, you know what, I think sometimes
people don't realize the entire situation

169
00:11:44,533 --> 00:11:47,771
and they're kind of like,
"Ew, why is she doing that."

170
00:11:47,795 --> 00:11:51,307
But we need to support each other.

171
00:11:51,331 --> 00:11:53,977
And if come together as a team

172
00:11:54,001 --> 00:11:55,395
and work together as a team

173
00:11:55,419 --> 00:11:58,982
then I think that would help.

174
00:11:59,006 --> 00:12:02,611
Okay. So maybe we can look at some courses

175
00:12:02,635 --> 00:12:05,405
and maybe we can get some extra help

176
00:12:05,429 --> 00:12:07,824
but you have to keep
talking to the three of us

177
00:12:07,848 --> 00:12:10,944
so we know what's going on
and we can support you.

178
00:12:10,968 --> 00:12:13,433
Yeah, and work together.
We all need to work together.

179
00:12:30,454 --> 00:12:38,454
Sarah.

180
00:13:00,231 --> 00:13:03,380
Sarah!

181
00:13:03,404 --> 00:13:05,566
One, two, three...!

182
00:13:08,144 --> 00:13:12,587
Sarah! Hi.

183
00:13:14,372 --> 00:13:17,211
- How did you get up there?
- I flew.

184
00:13:17,235 --> 00:13:19,580
- Do you want to come up here?
- Come up?

185
00:13:23,767 --> 00:13:25,787
Welcome to my palace.

186
00:13:28,428 --> 00:13:30,240
It's so nice.

187
00:13:31,857 --> 00:13:33,819
That's amazing.

188
00:13:36,321 --> 00:13:39,084
I like the wind.

189
00:13:50,261 --> 00:13:54,035
Ever since we went skydiving
I just want to be really high up.

190
00:14:04,048 --> 00:14:07,110
I want to work up until
being able to go by myself.

191
00:14:07,134 --> 00:14:08,945
Yeah?

192
00:14:08,969 --> 00:14:12,032
I didn't feel scared at all.

193
00:14:12,056 --> 00:14:14,575
Really?

194
00:14:14,599 --> 00:14:17,996
I was... yeah, I wasn't scared.

195
00:14:18,020 --> 00:14:26,020
Just kidding. I was really scared.

196
00:14:27,948 --> 00:14:30,652
Will you lift me?

197
00:14:30,676 --> 00:14:31,870
Ready?

198
00:14:35,941 --> 00:14:38,724
- Does it feel the same?
- No!

199
00:14:38,748 --> 00:14:40,328
Ready?

200
00:14:48,630 --> 00:14:50,647
Anne?

201
00:14:50,671 --> 00:14:52,363
- I'm Pat.
- Hi.

202
00:14:52,387 --> 00:14:55,059
- Nice to meet you. How are you?
- Nice to meet you too.

203
00:14:55,083 --> 00:14:58,161
- I'm good. How are you?
- I'm doing well, thank you.

204
00:14:58,185 --> 00:15:00,288
You look really different
than your picture.

205
00:15:00,312 --> 00:15:01,164
I'm sorry?

206
00:15:01,188 --> 00:15:02,916
You look really different
than your picture.

207
00:15:02,940 --> 00:15:05,719
I do? Hope I didn't disappoint you.

208
00:15:05,743 --> 00:15:11,194
No, that's not... You just look
like an entirely different person.

209
00:15:11,218 --> 00:15:13,459
Is that a good thing or a bad thing?
I don't know.

210
00:15:13,483 --> 00:15:15,210
Not good or bad.

211
00:15:16,954 --> 00:15:20,003
Just... Just, dis concerting.

212
00:15:20,027 --> 00:15:22,115
Well you look the same so...

213
00:15:22,139 --> 00:15:24,412
When I saw your photo I went to the right

214
00:15:24,436 --> 00:15:26,811
and you went to the right
when you saw mine and here we are.

215
00:15:26,835 --> 00:15:28,354
Yeah.

216
00:15:30,361 --> 00:15:31,922
I'm going to have a beer.

217
00:15:31,946 --> 00:15:33,868
Alright. I'm having a Miller Light.

218
00:15:33,892 --> 00:15:35,510
- Miller Light?
- Yeah.

219
00:15:35,534 --> 00:15:38,148
- I'll have the same thing.
- Okay.

220
00:15:38,172 --> 00:15:39,816
- Cheers.
- Yep, cheers.

221
00:15:40,946 --> 00:15:43,646
Your shirt is very well ironed.

222
00:15:43,670 --> 00:15:45,959
Thank you.

223
00:15:45,983 --> 00:15:47,671
I do my own ironing.

224
00:15:47,695 --> 00:15:50,949
Well, I live alone so,
you know, I have no choice.

225
00:15:50,973 --> 00:15:53,466
Right. I mean,
you could go tot he dry-cleaners.

226
00:15:53,490 --> 00:15:54,914
Oh I could.

227
00:15:54,938 --> 00:15:56,302
Are you from the area?

228
00:15:57,857 --> 00:15:59,514
Sort of yeah.

229
00:15:59,538 --> 00:16:02,395
- Yeah, I mean, West End.
- Yeah.

230
00:16:02,419 --> 00:16:05,388
And you're into... you work with kids?

231
00:16:06,713 --> 00:16:09,416
I work at a daycare, yeah.

232
00:16:09,440 --> 00:16:13,591
I'm not going to tell you which one,
because I don't know you yet.

233
00:16:13,615 --> 00:16:15,280
Oh I mean, I understand sure.

234
00:16:15,304 --> 00:16:18,388
I mean,
yeah we're basically two strangers.

235
00:16:18,412 --> 00:16:20,285
This is the first time we met, right?

236
00:16:20,309 --> 00:16:22,913
I know, I understand.

237
00:16:22,937 --> 00:16:25,173
I work for insurances.

238
00:16:25,197 --> 00:16:28,605
Feel free to go on
Mississaugalnsurances.com.

239
00:16:28,629 --> 00:16:32,713
I'm there. You'll see my photo.
You'll see what I do.

240
00:16:32,737 --> 00:16:34,377
We do everything.

241
00:16:35,517 --> 00:16:37,954
Auto, boat... life insurance.

242
00:16:37,978 --> 00:16:40,885
We do everything.
It's a good company.

243
00:16:42,367 --> 00:16:45,185
Do you like to travel?

244
00:16:45,209 --> 00:16:47,288
Not really.

245
00:16:47,312 --> 00:16:48,688
Do you like to travel?

246
00:16:48,712 --> 00:16:50,413
I don't have the time.

247
00:17:05,062 --> 00:17:08,666
There you go.

248
00:17:08,690 --> 00:17:09,960
Perfect.

249
00:17:09,984 --> 00:17:12,378
Okay, head up, just like that.

250
00:17:12,402 --> 00:17:14,547
Go. Awesome.

251
00:17:14,571 --> 00:17:16,216
Arms nice and even, right here.

252
00:17:16,240 --> 00:17:18,551
Put pressure on my hands, just like that.

253
00:17:18,575 --> 00:17:22,339
Head up. Perfect, okay, and relax.

254
00:17:22,363 --> 00:17:26,220
Couple steps. And then at about 500 feet
we're gonna stop.

255
00:17:26,244 --> 00:17:29,382
We're gonna pull down again
and we're gonna turn crosswind.

256
00:17:29,406 --> 00:17:32,142
There you go.
And then hands all the way up. Perfect.

257
00:17:32,166 --> 00:17:34,870
Now we're gonna fly crosswind
to the hangar so keep going,

258
00:17:34,894 --> 00:17:36,756
couple more steps.

259
00:17:36,780 --> 00:17:40,676
There you go. Arch. There we go.

260
00:17:42,682 --> 00:17:46,293
Alright. Nice and hard.
There you go. Reach back.

261
00:17:46,317 --> 00:17:47,751
And pull.

262
00:17:47,775 --> 00:17:49,124
Fantastic.

263
00:17:49,148 --> 00:17:51,084
Good job.

264
00:17:51,108 --> 00:17:53,878
What did I want to find?

265
00:17:53,902 --> 00:17:56,006
My hands were empty.

266
00:17:56,030 --> 00:17:58,799
Perhaps it's upstairs then.

267
00:17:58,823 --> 00:18:01,219
And in the garden, he whispered.

268
00:18:01,243 --> 00:18:04,180
"Quietly." They said.

269
00:18:04,204 --> 00:18:09,435
But it wasn't that you woke us, oh, no.

270
00:18:09,459 --> 00:18:12,438
They're looking for it.
They're drawing the curtain one might say.

271
00:18:12,462 --> 00:18:14,565
And so read on a page or two.

272
00:18:14,589 --> 00:18:16,109
Now they found it.

273
00:18:16,133 --> 00:18:17,318
One would be certain,

274
00:18:17,342 --> 00:18:19,820
stopping the pencil on the margin

275
00:18:19,844 --> 00:18:21,948
and then, tired of reading,

276
00:18:21,972 --> 00:18:24,284
one might rise and see for oneself

277
00:18:24,308 --> 00:18:28,329
the house all empty,
the door standing open,

278
00:18:28,353 --> 00:18:32,292
only the wood pigeons
bubbling with content

279
00:18:32,316 --> 00:18:34,585
and the hum of the threshing machine

280
00:18:34,609 --> 00:18:42,609
sounding from the farm.

281
00:18:45,079 --> 00:18:47,307
Anne, is that hot liquid?

282
00:18:47,331 --> 00:18:49,142
You know we can't have it in here right?

283
00:18:49,166 --> 00:18:57,166
Yeah, no, you're right. Sorry.

284
00:19:02,262 --> 00:19:06,409
Anne, the thing is like,
if an inspector came in or something

285
00:19:06,433 --> 00:19:08,078
it's on both of us right?

286
00:19:08,102 --> 00:19:10,246
- It's both of our faults.
- Okay. Okay.

287
00:19:10,270 --> 00:19:12,296
- Can you take care of it, please?
- Yep.

288
00:19:27,787 --> 00:19:31,059
Seriously.

289
00:19:31,083 --> 00:19:32,810
Why would you do that to me?

290
00:19:32,834 --> 00:19:35,646
It's an empty cup.

291
00:19:35,670 --> 00:19:38,066
I was just showing
you that I dumped it out.

292
00:19:38,090 --> 00:19:39,192
It's all gone.

293
00:19:39,216 --> 00:19:41,444
Thank you for dumping out the coffee

294
00:19:41,468 --> 00:19:43,852
but, seriously,
don't throw things at me, ever.

295
00:19:45,839 --> 00:19:48,371
I wouldn't do that to you
and I wouldn't do that to anyone else.

296
00:19:48,395 --> 00:19:50,703
I mean, you're welcome to.

297
00:19:50,727 --> 00:19:53,554
No that's okay.
It's extremely unprofessional.

298
00:19:53,578 --> 00:19:55,161
It's empty. I dumped it down the sink.

299
00:19:55,185 --> 00:19:57,502
Yeah, but you know what?
I got water on me.

300
00:19:57,526 --> 00:20:00,004
I just want you to look nice.
I want you to feel good.

301
00:20:00,028 --> 00:20:02,423
I want you to have a nice time.

302
00:20:02,447 --> 00:20:05,593
I just want you to relax a little bit.

303
00:20:05,617 --> 00:20:07,392
I'm not here to play.

304
00:20:07,416 --> 00:20:09,547
I'm here to do my job.

305
00:20:11,369 --> 00:20:13,227
Lookit.

306
00:20:14,543 --> 00:20:15,898
Anne.

307
00:20:15,922 --> 00:20:18,614
What can I do for you?
Because I think you're in trouble here.

308
00:20:18,638 --> 00:20:23,025
I didn't touch you.
I put the drink in the cup holder.

309
00:20:23,049 --> 00:20:27,115
- I put the drink in the cup holder.
- What is wrong with you?

310
00:20:32,897 --> 00:20:34,942
I want to help you

311
00:20:34,966 --> 00:20:38,395
but I can't if you're not gonna...

312
00:20:40,962 --> 00:20:42,716
Do you need to go talk to somebody?

313
00:20:42,740 --> 00:20:46,040
You're so, you're so dumb.

314
00:20:46,064 --> 00:20:48,029
You're so dumb.

315
00:20:48,053 --> 00:20:50,529
You think I want to work with you?

316
00:21:27,073 --> 00:21:31,637
Hey.

317
00:21:31,661 --> 00:21:36,058
Hey there, who'd you find huh?

318
00:21:36,082 --> 00:21:38,728
Hello.

319
00:21:38,752 --> 00:21:40,020
Good morning.

320
00:21:40,044 --> 00:21:44,275
Good morning.

321
00:21:44,299 --> 00:21:46,236
You okay?

322
00:21:47,886 --> 00:21:49,265
- Yeah.
- Okay.

323
00:21:50,649 --> 00:21:55,293
Do you want to come
stay for a couple days?

324
00:21:55,317 --> 00:21:58,233
No, that's okay. No.

325
00:21:58,257 --> 00:22:00,278
I just stayed for the night.

326
00:22:00,302 --> 00:22:03,294
Okay. Okay, but...

327
00:22:03,318 --> 00:22:05,255
anytime, anything is overwhelming

328
00:22:05,279 --> 00:22:08,174
or, I'm not saying it is but, you know,

329
00:22:08,198 --> 00:22:09,509
it can get that way.

330
00:22:09,533 --> 00:22:11,386
- No I get it.
- Cold feet.

331
00:22:11,410 --> 00:22:13,137
Anytime at all, any length of time.

332
00:22:13,161 --> 00:22:16,224
Okay but I'm just saying this
time I was just dropping in.

333
00:22:16,248 --> 00:22:19,486
But if I need to stay
longer I will let you know.

334
00:22:20,505 --> 00:22:22,397
I know that I can stay
and I appreciate it.

335
00:22:22,421 --> 00:22:23,478
Okay.

336
00:22:26,258 --> 00:22:29,300
And Ryan, do you take Sarah

337
00:22:29,324 --> 00:22:32,670
to be your lawfully wedded wife,
to have and to hold

338
00:22:32,694 --> 00:22:36,324
to honour and to cherish
as long as you both shall love?

339
00:22:36,348 --> 00:22:38,946
I do.

340
00:22:38,970 --> 00:22:40,978
Ryan, you may give her her ring.

341
00:22:45,402 --> 00:22:49,914
It's my great honour
to pronounce you man and wife.

342
00:23:03,753 --> 00:23:05,157
She looked so beautiful.

343
00:23:05,181 --> 00:23:06,282
She did, I know.

344
00:23:08,473 --> 00:23:10,903
Are you enjoying your bubbly yet?

345
00:23:10,927 --> 00:23:13,489
Yeah, I'm gonna have to go back for more.

346
00:23:13,513 --> 00:23:15,556
I can see that.

347
00:23:15,580 --> 00:23:18,462
Can you tell me,
what is it like to be young and beautiful?

348
00:23:19,735 --> 00:23:21,428
Oh I don't know.

349
00:23:21,452 --> 00:23:23,417
No, you're living it. You must know.

350
00:23:23,441 --> 00:23:24,804
It feels powerful.

351
00:23:24,828 --> 00:23:27,002
Ooh. Very good answer. Very good.

352
00:23:27,026 --> 00:23:30,005
And you know,
that's the best answer I've ever gotten.

353
00:23:30,029 --> 00:23:31,874
She's gonna run the other way now.

354
00:23:34,183 --> 00:23:35,645
You've scared her.

355
00:23:35,669 --> 00:23:37,116
- You've scared her.
- Come here.

356
00:23:43,126 --> 00:23:45,229
They're gonna have a
wonderful prosperous life.

357
00:23:45,253 --> 00:23:47,239
They looked so matching.

358
00:24:08,943 --> 00:24:14,592
Hi, my name is Anne and I work
at the Children's Circle with Sarah.

359
00:24:14,616 --> 00:24:18,220
Um, when I first started
working at the daycare

360
00:24:18,244 --> 00:24:20,556
she made me feel really welcomed

361
00:24:20,580 --> 00:24:25,978
and even when I made
lots of mistakes with the kids,

362
00:24:26,002 --> 00:24:29,774
like when I left a kid in his snowsuit

363
00:24:29,798 --> 00:24:33,068
for a few hours inside and he fainted

364
00:24:33,092 --> 00:24:36,406
yeah,
she didn't make me feel like an idiot.

365
00:24:36,430 --> 00:24:39,700
So that was - and she
made the kid wake up.

366
00:24:39,724 --> 00:24:41,869
She gave him some water,

367
00:24:41,893 --> 00:24:43,698
which was nice.

368
00:24:58,993 --> 00:25:00,721
Sarah, you're, yeah,

369
00:25:00,745 --> 00:25:02,598
you just make everyone that's around you

370
00:25:02,622 --> 00:25:07,728
feel really good about themselves.

371
00:25:07,752 --> 00:25:11,315
And that they could do anything stupid

372
00:25:11,339 --> 00:25:18,448
and that you'd probably forgive them.

373
00:25:18,472 --> 00:25:24,328
If I...

374
00:25:24,352 --> 00:25:26,872
If I didn't have you
when I was at the daycare

375
00:25:26,896 --> 00:25:31,461
maybe... maybe I would
have gotten really in my head

376
00:25:31,485 --> 00:25:38,050
and really scared that something
might happen to the kids.

377
00:25:38,074 --> 00:25:40,511
And I might have thought
I was bad or something

378
00:25:40,535 --> 00:25:45,391
and that I couldn't be around the kids.

379
00:25:45,415 --> 00:25:48,018
But...

380
00:25:48,042 --> 00:25:49,395
you made me feel that I was good

381
00:25:49,419 --> 00:25:53,065
and that I could do my job

382
00:25:53,089 --> 00:25:55,860
and that I could do a good job.

383
00:25:55,884 --> 00:26:00,573
And, yeah, Ryan's really lucky.

384
00:26:00,597 --> 00:26:06,370
And if you do anything
to hurt her I'll kill you.

385
00:26:06,394 --> 00:26:09,164
No, I think you think you
guys'll be really happy.

386
00:26:09,188 --> 00:26:15,212
And I don't know Ryan,
maybe he contributes too, I don't know.

387
00:26:15,236 --> 00:26:17,297
Um... okay, I love you.

388
00:26:17,321 --> 00:26:18,790
I love you too.

389
00:26:52,774 --> 00:26:54,662
I liked your speech.

390
00:27:00,592 --> 00:27:02,177
- Really?
- Yes, I loved it.

391
00:27:02,201 --> 00:27:04,386
In fact, I thought it was
the most sincere thing that...

392
00:27:04,410 --> 00:27:06,514
I thought it was better than the vows.

393
00:27:06,538 --> 00:27:09,934
I liked the snowshoe - the snowsuit bit.

394
00:27:09,958 --> 00:27:13,740
I liked the "you're
gonna kill the husband" bit,

395
00:27:13,764 --> 00:27:16,065
- even though he's my best friend.
- That's a classic.

396
00:27:16,089 --> 00:27:17,149
Always kills.

397
00:27:17,173 --> 00:27:20,695
I stole that from other weddings.

398
00:27:20,719 --> 00:27:22,530
Yeah, well, it always looks good

399
00:27:22,554 --> 00:27:25,847
when the maid of honour
threatens to kill the new husband.

400
00:27:27,154 --> 00:27:29,835
It's very animal kingdom.

401
00:27:29,859 --> 00:27:32,971
Okay, I'm gonna go back
to the other side of the room and sit.

402
00:27:32,995 --> 00:27:36,208
I just thought I'd come over and see
what this side of the room was like.

403
00:27:36,232 --> 00:27:38,255
You're Matt, right?

404
00:27:38,279 --> 00:27:40,185
I know you're Anne.

405
00:27:44,573 --> 00:27:47,096
Okay, so how do you know the bride?

406
00:27:47,120 --> 00:27:50,263
Didn't you hear my speech?

407
00:27:50,287 --> 00:27:53,185
Okay, so that's where
you met her for real?

408
00:27:53,209 --> 00:27:55,521
Okay, so wait a minute,
you've known Sarah three years

409
00:27:56,880 --> 00:27:58,884
and you're already the maid of honour?

410
00:27:59,989 --> 00:28:02,134
Did you have to kill everybody else?

411
00:28:10,059 --> 00:28:12,622
- You guys are dancing?
- Yes.

412
00:28:12,646 --> 00:28:14,786
I was telling her it was the best
bridesmaid speech I'd ever heard.

413
00:28:14,810 --> 00:28:17,752
He said that everyone hated
my speech except for him.

414
00:28:17,776 --> 00:28:19,077
- No.
- That's negging.

415
00:28:19,101 --> 00:28:22,828
That's what she said!
I didn't even know hat that meant!

416
00:28:26,117 --> 00:28:28,507
You okay?

417
00:28:33,357 --> 00:28:35,115
I think...

418
00:28:36,204 --> 00:28:38,414
That's enough.

419
00:28:40,106 --> 00:28:42,450
Don't finish it.

420
00:28:45,929 --> 00:28:48,293
Oh, thank you.

421
00:28:50,179 --> 00:28:52,745
I love the dress.

422
00:28:52,769 --> 00:28:55,678
I wanted to say it earlier
but I was too shy.

423
00:28:56,709 --> 00:28:58,154
I'm not good with...

424
00:28:59,906 --> 00:29:03,257
So tomorrow you're gonna be cogent,
no sunglasses.

425
00:29:03,281 --> 00:29:06,411
As long as the alcohol is the clear kind,

426
00:29:06,435 --> 00:29:13,737
like white wine, or champagne or vodka
it's fine.

427
00:29:13,761 --> 00:29:17,426
I think it's because
I have Polish ancestry

428
00:29:17,450 --> 00:29:21,815
and if you drink the thing
from you ancestors,

429
00:29:21,839 --> 00:29:24,933
that your ancestors made
with their own feet...

430
00:29:26,079 --> 00:29:27,780
then you're...

431
00:29:29,203 --> 00:29:31,088
- fine.
- Yeah?

432
00:29:31,112 --> 00:29:37,847
Once you see me tomorrow,
I will be bright and sunny.

433
00:29:37,871 --> 00:29:42,887
- Just start drinking and all good.
- Totally. It's a wedding

434
00:29:42,911 --> 00:29:49,009
and like, I think that, for the most part,
you can self-medicate

435
00:29:49,033 --> 00:29:53,002
where you like,
you have like a glass of wine and...

436
00:29:53,026 --> 00:29:54,640
White wine, I'm noticing.

437
00:29:54,664 --> 00:29:55,990
Lots of white wine.

438
00:29:56,014 --> 00:29:57,822
My skill that I learned -

439
00:29:58,905 --> 00:30:01,230
day drinking.

440
00:30:01,254 --> 00:30:03,832
Okay? Then night drinking.

441
00:30:06,843 --> 00:30:08,849
- Brunch drinking.
- Yeah.

442
00:30:08,873 --> 00:30:10,934
I'm trying to, whatever, you know.

443
00:30:11,962 --> 00:30:13,450
Connect, yeah, that's the word.

444
00:30:13,474 --> 00:30:15,966
Or no, I'm trying to be as sincere as you.

445
00:30:15,990 --> 00:30:17,537
Not the exact same thing

446
00:30:17,561 --> 00:30:21,986
but when I was 16,
I went on antidepressants

447
00:30:22,010 --> 00:30:24,830
because I, in my opinion,
well you know what?

448
00:30:24,854 --> 00:30:27,412
I would get home from school
every day and go to sleep.

449
00:30:27,436 --> 00:30:31,208
And my parents were like,
"Oh, my God, you're depressed."

450
00:30:31,232 --> 00:30:35,317
But really I was just insanely
addicted to EverQuest

451
00:30:35,341 --> 00:30:37,823
which was an online video game.

452
00:30:37,847 --> 00:30:40,624
Ask me about it later,
I will talk to you about it for days.

453
00:30:40,648 --> 00:30:44,151
Imagine a world thousands
of player characters

454
00:30:44,175 --> 00:30:45,843
all existing in a role playing game...

455
00:30:45,867 --> 00:30:48,128
You were just depressed
because you were a huge nerd.

456
00:30:48,152 --> 00:30:51,309
No, I was obsessed because I was playing
it nonstop with my brother all the time

457
00:30:51,333 --> 00:30:54,922
and my life fell apart, and...

458
00:30:54,946 --> 00:30:57,327
I'm trying to humble
myself before you here.

459
00:30:57,351 --> 00:30:59,789
So got put on antidepressants by my Mum,
who is a doctor.

460
00:30:59,813 --> 00:31:02,124
Do you still take them now?

461
00:31:02,148 --> 00:31:03,751
No.

462
00:31:03,775 --> 00:31:11,775
I'm just gonna go to the wash room.

463
00:31:31,803 --> 00:31:34,531
Anne?

464
00:31:34,555 --> 00:31:39,995
Are you still in there? It's Matt.

465
00:31:40,019 --> 00:31:42,622
You were just talking with me.

466
00:31:42,646 --> 00:31:46,794
We were falling in love. Do you remember?

467
00:31:46,818 --> 00:31:51,423
I'm coming in.

468
00:31:51,447 --> 00:31:55,010
Anne?

469
00:31:55,034 --> 00:31:57,346
You okay?

470
00:31:57,370 --> 00:32:00,640
- Hi.
- You awake?

471
00:32:00,664 --> 00:32:02,267
Stop kicking me.

472
00:32:02,291 --> 00:32:10,567
You want some water?

473
00:32:10,591 --> 00:32:15,489
Thank you.

474
00:32:15,513 --> 00:32:20,535
I think I ate something weird.

475
00:32:20,559 --> 00:32:22,526
Yeah, definitely.

476
00:32:24,477 --> 00:32:27,126
Yeah, you know what? A lot of the guests
I think ate the same thing

477
00:32:27,150 --> 00:32:30,963
because it's just a river of vomit
out there.

478
00:32:30,987 --> 00:32:32,870
Don't say the word vomit.

479
00:32:32,894 --> 00:32:36,939
You know what? Nobody knows
that you were sick except for me

480
00:32:36,963 --> 00:32:39,859
and anybody within 60 feet of the door
who could hear everything.

481
00:32:39,883 --> 00:32:41,351
Nah!

482
00:32:42,700 --> 00:32:44,786
Nobody heard anything.
I'm just teasing you.

483
00:32:49,760 --> 00:32:51,316
Thank you.

484
00:32:51,340 --> 00:32:55,793
It's like you're a prisoner and I'm a nun.

485
00:32:55,817 --> 00:32:57,907
Are there still more people there?

486
00:32:57,931 --> 00:32:59,213
No, this is...

487
00:32:59,237 --> 00:33:01,060
You've been here for like, 30 minutes.

488
00:33:01,084 --> 00:33:03,335
The place is like empty.
There's stragglers.

489
00:33:03,359 --> 00:33:05,003
You're doing great.

490
00:33:06,822 --> 00:33:08,319
Okay, come on. Let's go.

491
00:33:09,790 --> 00:33:13,656
Okay, so I'm remembering...

492
00:33:13,680 --> 00:33:19,599
white wine, mezcal... vodka.

493
00:33:19,623 --> 00:33:21,763
- No problem.
- No problem.

494
00:33:21,787 --> 00:33:24,683
Was it that my genes...

495
00:33:24,707 --> 00:33:26,310
Yeah...

496
00:33:30,849 --> 00:33:32,761
Hold them, hold them.

497
00:33:38,207 --> 00:33:39,868
You good?

498
00:33:57,965 --> 00:33:59,462
Oh! Sorry.

499
00:33:59,486 --> 00:34:02,586
Bad Anne.
It is Bad Anne, and she's back.

500
00:34:02,610 --> 00:34:04,233
Bad Anne is back.

501
00:34:04,257 --> 00:34:05,706
Sorry, man.

502
00:34:07,213 --> 00:34:09,088
Nine steps.

503
00:34:09,112 --> 00:34:12,765
You're flying. Yeah, okay, yeah.

504
00:34:12,789 --> 00:34:14,465
No, no, no, no.

505
00:34:20,069 --> 00:34:24,671
- Excuse me.
- You're excused. We're here.

506
00:34:27,895 --> 00:34:29,496
Come on.

507
00:34:31,133 --> 00:34:32,692
Okay.

508
00:34:32,716 --> 00:34:34,240
You're going up. I got you.

509
00:34:34,264 --> 00:34:38,004
Ready? I'm gonna be right back.
I'm not abandoning you.

510
00:34:38,028 --> 00:34:39,841
Okay?

511
00:34:39,865 --> 00:34:41,162
Okay?

512
00:34:42,258 --> 00:34:43,846
Okay.

513
00:34:52,708 --> 00:34:54,234
Okay.

514
00:34:55,486 --> 00:34:57,018
Yes.

515
00:34:58,605 --> 00:35:02,531
One, two... oh, please. Thank God.

516
00:35:02,555 --> 00:35:05,170
Okay. Here's the plan.

517
00:35:06,229 --> 00:35:09,044
You are in the bed. Okay?

518
00:35:18,734 --> 00:35:20,998
<i>I don't like the person
who made the movie</i> Jaws

519
00:35:21,022 --> 00:35:25,254
but the person that wrote the book,
I like her.

520
00:35:25,278 --> 00:35:28,340
It's about a great white shark
that goes on a rampage

521
00:35:28,364 --> 00:35:32,041
because it has an uncontrollable urge
for human...

522
00:35:32,065 --> 00:35:34,424
for human flesh.

523
00:35:34,448 --> 00:35:36,007
There's this girl...

524
00:35:36,031 --> 00:35:39,038
She's... No, she's not in <i>Jaws,</i>

525
00:35:39,062 --> 00:35:42,487
she's in <i>Soul Surfer</i>
and she's like this girl,

526
00:35:42,511 --> 00:35:46,836
she was surfing
and the shark attacked her and...

527
00:35:46,860 --> 00:35:48,594
In real life or in the movie?

528
00:35:48,618 --> 00:35:50,994
I think maybe in real life?

529
00:35:51,018 --> 00:35:53,107
Or maybe in the movie.

530
00:35:53,131 --> 00:35:56,716
But it might be a documentary.

531
00:35:56,740 --> 00:36:01,779
But the shark apparently attacked her
and took off this whole thing go bye-bye.

532
00:36:01,803 --> 00:36:03,538
And she was walking around like,

533
00:36:03,562 --> 00:36:06,678
If one shark bites your arm off,
then more come because...

534
00:36:06,702 --> 00:36:11,766
Yeah, and then it comes
into a feeding frenzy. It's literally...

535
00:36:11,790 --> 00:36:16,938
So you admit that sharks want human flesh.

536
00:36:16,962 --> 00:36:20,900
I admit... No, I admit nothing!

537
00:36:20,924 --> 00:36:23,954
You admit that
like the blockbuster movie <i>Jaws</i>...

538
00:36:23,978 --> 00:36:25,811
I admit!

539
00:36:27,329 --> 00:36:30,013
- What are you doing, Oliver?
- I'm trying to open this gate.

540
00:36:34,170 --> 00:36:34,913
What are you doing?

541
00:36:34,937 --> 00:36:36,125
I'm trying to open this gate,
what does it look like I'm doing?

542
00:36:36,149 --> 00:36:37,377
Why?

543
00:36:37,401 --> 00:36:39,197
Because my dad is literally over there.

544
00:36:39,221 --> 00:36:41,900
Hi, Dad, can I have a little bit longer?

545
00:36:41,924 --> 00:36:44,174
- Couple minutes.
- Yeah!

546
00:36:44,198 --> 00:36:46,703
- Hi.
- Hey.

547
00:36:46,727 --> 00:36:49,787
- How's it going?
- Good.

548
00:36:49,811 --> 00:36:52,044
Listen...

549
00:36:52,068 --> 00:36:54,349
about what happened at the wading pool...

550
00:36:54,373 --> 00:36:58,068
I was a little... curt.

551
00:36:58,092 --> 00:37:01,061
Yeah, no problem.
Sorry that I got him soaking wet.

552
00:37:02,139 --> 00:37:03,852
It's okay.

553
00:37:03,876 --> 00:37:07,417
Listen, he thinks the world
of you and I...

554
00:37:07,441 --> 00:37:10,897
I know how much you care for him,
so if you're still willing to...

555
00:37:10,921 --> 00:37:13,007
to watch him sometimes,
he would love that.

556
00:37:14,075 --> 00:37:16,614
- Yeah.
- Maybe one night next week?

557
00:37:17,794 --> 00:37:20,848
Like Tuesday? Wednesday? Yeah?

558
00:37:20,872 --> 00:37:22,177
Good.

559
00:37:23,435 --> 00:37:25,213
I should get him.

560
00:37:25,237 --> 00:37:28,240
Ollie, let's go.

561
00:37:28,264 --> 00:37:29,791
Bye, Oliver.

562
00:37:29,815 --> 00:37:31,789
- Let's go. Say bye.
- Bye.

563
00:37:31,813 --> 00:37:33,399
- Bye.
- Bye.

564
00:37:48,846 --> 00:37:52,466
Hi, so your tag is still on your dress.

565
00:37:52,490 --> 00:37:55,111
Do you want me to just
take it off for you? Yeah?

566
00:37:55,135 --> 00:37:57,381
Sure.

567
00:37:58,625 --> 00:38:01,054
- I just bought it.
- It's a nice dress.

568
00:38:01,078 --> 00:38:03,107
- Thank you.
- There you go.

569
00:38:11,151 --> 00:38:13,614
- Hi.
- Hi.

570
00:38:13,638 --> 00:38:15,471
Hi, oh, my gosh, how are you?

571
00:38:15,495 --> 00:38:17,230
- Oh, hello.
- I'm Matt.

572
00:38:17,254 --> 00:38:19,686
- This is Matt. This is Matt.
- Nice to meet you.

573
00:38:19,710 --> 00:38:21,486
Lizzie. Barb.

574
00:38:21,510 --> 00:38:23,638
Hello. Hi.

575
00:38:23,662 --> 00:38:25,483
He's just having a lollipop,
it's a treat.

576
00:38:25,507 --> 00:38:26,816
- Hello.
- Here you go.

577
00:38:26,840 --> 00:38:28,553
- Thank you.
- That's for dinner.

578
00:38:28,577 --> 00:38:30,506
Hi. I would get up but I'm just...
I'll just...

579
00:38:30,530 --> 00:38:31,995
Don't even move.

580
00:38:32,019 --> 00:38:33,367
- You're Anne's sister?
- Yes.

581
00:38:33,391 --> 00:38:34,451
- What's your name?
- Lizzie.

582
00:38:34,475 --> 00:38:37,072
- Lizzie. Okay. And who's this guy?
- Sorry, we have so many toys in the way.

583
00:38:37,096 --> 00:38:38,872
No, no, I don't mind.

584
00:38:38,896 --> 00:38:41,541
- These are very elegant creatures.
- Yeah.

585
00:38:41,565 --> 00:38:43,066
The dogs hate you.

586
00:38:43,090 --> 00:38:44,362
Usually they're all over people.

587
00:38:44,386 --> 00:38:46,045
They're just like completely
keeping their distance.

588
00:38:46,069 --> 00:38:49,624
Oh you know what?
I don't mind. Nice to meet you.

589
00:38:49,648 --> 00:38:51,590
Handshake. Very professional.

590
00:38:51,614 --> 00:38:52,886
This is Ben?

591
00:38:52,910 --> 00:38:55,597
Yeah, Nathan and Ben
are getting to know each other.

592
00:38:55,621 --> 00:38:58,631
It's your first time meeting Ben, yeah.

593
00:38:58,655 --> 00:39:01,727
Oh, this is a good one.
Exposed chassis. Exposed motor.

594
00:39:02,942 --> 00:39:04,045
Beautiful.

595
00:39:04,069 --> 00:39:05,532
Are we really, really early?

596
00:39:05,556 --> 00:39:07,317
- Is that what's going on?
- No, no, not at all.

597
00:39:07,341 --> 00:39:09,239
We're just playing a bit.
We're just playing.

598
00:39:09,263 --> 00:39:12,705
We've been playing all day.
I didn't tell them you were coming.

599
00:39:12,729 --> 00:39:14,973
Okay. Sorry.

600
00:39:14,997 --> 00:39:17,173
Anne told me that we were
having dinner with her family

601
00:39:17,197 --> 00:39:19,413
and I thought that you guys knew
that I was coming over.

602
00:39:19,437 --> 00:39:21,609
I would never have said,
"Did we get here early?"

603
00:39:22,798 --> 00:39:25,627
- Yeah, no, I understand that.
- Honestly, you're totally welcome.

604
00:39:25,651 --> 00:39:29,086
- Anne, why didn't you just tell them?
- I just wanted to me her uncomfortable.

605
00:39:29,110 --> 00:39:30,424
Isn't that face...

606
00:39:30,448 --> 00:39:33,760
Isn't just seeing that face
worth every penny?

607
00:39:33,784 --> 00:39:34,927
Every penny.

608
00:39:37,706 --> 00:39:40,412
Do I need to teach everyone
how to have a conversation?

609
00:39:40,436 --> 00:39:42,176
You came with such energy

610
00:39:42,200 --> 00:39:47,236
and you really put us
in such a high tension situation, Anne.

611
00:39:48,263 --> 00:39:51,665
This is your first grandson?
Or first grandchild?

612
00:39:51,689 --> 00:39:54,914
- Always the best.
- Yeah.

613
00:39:54,938 --> 00:39:59,550
- Your name is Matt.
- You got it, yeah. Bingo. You killed it.

614
00:39:59,574 --> 00:40:00,699
Put 'er there.

615
00:40:00,723 --> 00:40:02,293
You're so smart.

616
00:40:02,317 --> 00:40:04,619
Your name is Nathan.

617
00:40:04,643 --> 00:40:07,090
Uncle Matt. Uncle Matt.

618
00:40:07,114 --> 00:40:08,258
Uncle Matt.

619
00:40:15,300 --> 00:40:18,318
- You tow have a lot in common.
- I'm sorry, what is it that you do?

620
00:40:18,342 --> 00:40:20,800
- I work at the Science Centre.
- Amazing!

621
00:40:20,824 --> 00:40:22,515
- As a...
- I love that place.

622
00:40:22,539 --> 00:40:25,775
Okay, have you seen the people
walking around in white lab coats?

623
00:40:25,799 --> 00:40:28,492
That kind of give tours? That's what I do.
You know what?

624
00:40:28,516 --> 00:40:31,417
He would be perfect on the second floor.
There's a place called Kids Park

625
00:40:31,441 --> 00:40:34,647
where it's all...
You have to be under eight just to get in.

626
00:40:34,671 --> 00:40:38,533
In fact, they don't let people in unless
they're accompanied my a kid under eight.

627
00:40:38,557 --> 00:40:41,161
- So you guys have a pass.
- It's for the pervs.

628
00:40:41,185 --> 00:40:43,450
That's not an official slogan.

629
00:40:43,474 --> 00:40:47,714
This is when you ask our guest
personal questions about himself.

630
00:40:47,738 --> 00:40:49,952
- Oh, I'm sorry.
- Where are you from?

631
00:40:49,976 --> 00:40:51,256
What's your favourite colour?

632
00:40:51,280 --> 00:40:54,794
No, no, no, no. You don't have to...

633
00:40:54,818 --> 00:40:56,859
You don't have to ask me anything.
You know what...?

634
00:40:56,883 --> 00:40:58,861
No, I'll ask you something.
Let's see. Where are you from?

635
00:40:58,885 --> 00:41:02,348
- Toronto. Not far from here.
- How did you two meet?

636
00:41:02,372 --> 00:41:04,484
We met at Sarah and Jeff's wedding
about a month ago.

637
00:41:04,508 --> 00:41:06,730
- Oh, okay.
- You're so weird!

638
00:41:06,754 --> 00:41:11,244
She had lost her purse
and I was the only person...

639
00:41:11,268 --> 00:41:13,572
We were staying in the same hotel,
everybody was staying in the same hotel,

640
00:41:13,596 --> 00:41:17,808
and so I helped her get back to the hotel.

641
00:41:17,832 --> 00:41:19,658
I shouldn't say,
"helped her get back to the hotel."

642
00:41:19,682 --> 00:41:21,946
Basically she needed help,
what am I saying?

643
00:41:21,970 --> 00:41:27,677
She needed help and I helped her
and we had been talking before that...

644
00:41:31,648 --> 00:41:34,297
- And everything was great.
- Are you okay Matt?

645
00:41:34,321 --> 00:41:37,553
Yeah. You know what? It's...

646
00:41:37,577 --> 00:41:39,678
What's the word for it?

647
00:41:39,702 --> 00:41:41,848
Thrown into a new situation.

648
00:41:41,872 --> 00:41:44,223
You're doing great. You're doing great.

649
00:41:44,247 --> 00:41:49,846
It's just funny seeing you thrive
in this situation.

650
00:41:49,870 --> 00:41:52,521
You guys are making Nathan laugh too,
look.

651
00:41:52,545 --> 00:41:55,450
- He's laughing too.
- So anyway, moving on.

652
00:41:55,474 --> 00:41:58,321
Actually, Ben has a trick. Ben. Ben!

653
00:41:58,345 --> 00:42:00,532
Ben's sleeping. Ben's having a nap.

654
00:42:00,556 --> 00:42:02,913
I think that he's all worn out.
He's worn out.

655
00:42:02,937 --> 00:42:05,454
Go on his lap. Go on
his lap. Go on his lap.

656
00:42:05,478 --> 00:42:07,728
Ben, Ben, Ben. Come on his lap.

657
00:42:07,752 --> 00:42:09,320
Get on his lap.

658
00:42:09,344 --> 00:42:12,412
- Hey Ben.
- Ben. Now do the trick.

659
00:42:12,436 --> 00:42:14,087
Paws. Paws, paws, paws.

660
00:42:14,111 --> 00:42:16,339
I think he'll do it because
he's really worn out today.

661
00:42:16,363 --> 00:42:20,180
I think he's new...
He needs to really know someone.

662
00:42:21,410 --> 00:42:22,911
Don't force him.

663
00:42:22,935 --> 00:42:26,311
Yeah, you know what?
Maybe after dinner I'll get the...

664
00:42:27,557 --> 00:42:29,579
But, look, he likes you.

665
00:42:29,603 --> 00:42:32,291
That's very...
I mean it must be a good sign about you.

666
00:42:32,315 --> 00:42:34,401
What a handsome pair.

667
00:42:38,530 --> 00:42:40,827
Can you tell me a bit more what happened?

668
00:42:46,105 --> 00:42:49,910
Okay so I'm not quite sure
why you can't tell me,

669
00:42:49,934 --> 00:42:51,942
but I'll tell you what Suzanne said.

670
00:42:54,192 --> 00:42:57,310
She said that you threw a cup at her

671
00:42:57,334 --> 00:43:00,204
and then you tried
to put it down her shirt.

672
00:43:00,228 --> 00:43:03,146
And then on top of it,
it was in front of children.

673
00:43:04,484 --> 00:43:06,025
And she got pretty upset.

674
00:43:06,049 --> 00:43:08,065
- I don't think...
- And you got pretty upset.

675
00:43:08,089 --> 00:43:11,484
The kids seemed to notice it.

676
00:43:11,508 --> 00:43:14,481
So do think that was okay behaviour?

677
00:43:14,505 --> 00:43:16,107
I was just showing her
that I'd done what she asked.

678
00:43:16,131 --> 00:43:18,268
I was showing her
that I dumped out the tea.

679
00:43:19,312 --> 00:43:21,517
Like I know if I had just gone
and put it in the garbage

680
00:43:21,541 --> 00:43:23,947
she'd just tell me to put it
in the recycling.

681
00:43:25,317 --> 00:43:28,504
So I was just trying to get her to like...

682
00:43:28,528 --> 00:43:30,705
stop paying attention to me.

683
00:43:30,729 --> 00:43:32,533
You know, pay attention to her own work.

684
00:43:32,557 --> 00:43:35,910
I was just showing her
that I did what she asked.

685
00:43:35,934 --> 00:43:39,259
So I think Suzanne has been a long time.

686
00:43:39,283 --> 00:43:41,983
I think she takes the job
really seriously,

687
00:43:42,007 --> 00:43:45,804
so maybe when she's telling you
that you're not following the rules

688
00:43:45,828 --> 00:43:47,394
she's trying to help.

689
00:43:47,418 --> 00:43:51,057
So maybe we need to step back,
look at what's working well,

690
00:43:51,081 --> 00:43:54,628
and then come up with a solution,
communications

691
00:43:54,652 --> 00:43:56,355
for when things aren't working well.

692
00:43:56,379 --> 00:44:01,860
So why don't we say every Friday
we'll get together for maybe half an hour.

693
00:44:01,884 --> 00:44:05,579
You'll both come to the meeting
with things that are working

694
00:44:05,603 --> 00:44:08,466
and then come up with something
that's not working

695
00:44:08,490 --> 00:44:11,704
and then I need to see
that you're coming up with solutions.

696
00:44:11,728 --> 00:44:14,246
I just feel like if we...

697
00:44:14,270 --> 00:44:18,824
have weekly meetings that means
that she's gonna be observing me

698
00:44:18,848 --> 00:44:20,729
and I don't want her to be observing me.

699
00:44:20,753 --> 00:44:23,444
So I am totally not doing that.

700
00:44:23,468 --> 00:44:25,781
Would you prefer that I not let you know

701
00:44:25,805 --> 00:44:27,818
if you've broken a rule
and you don't realise it?

702
00:44:27,842 --> 00:44:30,060
And then somebody walks
in and sees you doing it.

703
00:44:30,084 --> 00:44:31,516
Would you prefer that?

704
00:44:31,540 --> 00:44:34,537
Because if that's what you want,
that's fine.

705
00:44:34,561 --> 00:44:37,540
Yeah, tell me what you want from me.

706
00:44:37,564 --> 00:44:39,418
Because...

707
00:44:39,442 --> 00:44:41,528
it changes all the time.

708
00:44:45,094 --> 00:44:47,093
I just feel...

709
00:44:48,340 --> 00:44:50,254
like she's always picking on me.

710
00:44:50,278 --> 00:44:53,755
Like, it wouldn't matter what I was doing,

711
00:44:53,779 --> 00:44:57,302
she'd find something to correct me on

712
00:44:57,326 --> 00:45:00,947
and that makes me feel like...

713
00:45:05,152 --> 00:45:08,827
like I don't have freedom in the room

714
00:45:08,851 --> 00:45:10,871
to learn myself.

715
00:45:10,895 --> 00:45:14,778
Like she's always kind of
breathing down my neck.

716
00:45:14,802 --> 00:45:17,771
I'm just trying to help.
I really, truthfully am trying to help.

717
00:45:17,795 --> 00:45:20,222
I would think you'd know that.

718
00:45:28,717 --> 00:45:31,063
- Hi.
- Can you go get a coffee?

719
00:45:31,087 --> 00:45:32,827
Not right now.

720
00:45:32,851 --> 00:45:36,085
I'm, this is very important business.

721
00:45:36,109 --> 00:45:37,972
Have you seen this?

722
00:45:37,996 --> 00:45:40,960
- My name's Anne.
- Hello, Anne.

723
00:45:40,984 --> 00:45:42,205
Hello Anne.

724
00:45:43,556 --> 00:45:48,313
You guys wouldn't care if Sarah
came and got a coffee with me right?

725
00:45:48,337 --> 00:45:50,731
- I would.
- Yes, exactly!

726
00:45:50,755 --> 00:45:52,512
That's so nice.

727
00:45:52,536 --> 00:45:54,880
There's like four teachers in the room.

728
00:45:54,904 --> 00:45:58,102
- No one will notice if you come get...
- I know but there's like 90 kids.

729
00:45:58,126 --> 00:46:01,655
It's not worth being caught.
It's not worth...

730
00:46:01,679 --> 00:46:04,054
I have to be here. It's my job.

731
00:46:04,078 --> 00:46:08,090
Well, I'm not getting you anything.

732
00:46:13,512 --> 00:46:14,615
What's going on?

733
00:46:14,639 --> 00:46:16,002
Who is it?

734
00:46:16,026 --> 00:46:17,979
Who is it?

735
00:46:19,361 --> 00:46:21,713
Hey! Yeah!

736
00:46:23,870 --> 00:46:25,575
Okay.

737
00:46:26,613 --> 00:46:28,857
What are you doing this for?

738
00:46:30,282 --> 00:46:33,191
Remember, this is what I told you
we did for Sarah's bachelorette party.

739
00:46:33,215 --> 00:46:35,449
Okay, yeah. You look like Bugs Bunny.

740
00:46:37,057 --> 00:46:38,471
Like a lot.

741
00:46:42,295 --> 00:46:43,624
Then what?

742
00:46:43,648 --> 00:46:46,190
What happens?
She pulls the parachute and what?

743
00:46:46,214 --> 00:46:48,799
I obviously didn't react
the way you wanted me to.

744
00:46:48,823 --> 00:46:51,028
I think the jump looks really great.

745
00:46:51,052 --> 00:46:54,376
And it would be great if I got to see
the landing on the ground.

746
00:46:54,400 --> 00:46:55,473
That's it.

747
00:46:55,497 --> 00:46:57,394
You just have to do it,
or you don't understand.

748
00:46:59,642 --> 00:47:01,141
I have to jump?

749
00:47:01,165 --> 00:47:03,678
I don't know if I'm looking
for that kind of thrill in my life.

750
00:47:03,702 --> 00:47:06,216
I didn't even enjoy watching the video.

751
00:47:06,240 --> 00:47:08,095
For me a thrill is like, okay,

752
00:47:08,119 --> 00:47:13,141
I'm kind of casually dating a girl and she
takes me to her parent's house, unannounced

753
00:47:13,165 --> 00:47:15,680
and says, "Hey this is my boyfriend,
we're getting married."

754
00:47:15,704 --> 00:47:18,325
That's enough, that is my version
of jumping out of a plane.

755
00:47:18,349 --> 00:47:21,962
What did they think about that?
Did you follow up with them?

756
00:47:21,986 --> 00:47:25,634
Did your mum and sister say anything like,
"Who was that guy?

757
00:47:25,658 --> 00:47:27,647
- "Why was he at...?"
- Yeah, no, they really liked you.

758
00:47:27,671 --> 00:47:28,803
They did?

759
00:47:28,827 --> 00:47:31,225
Did you tell them
that we're only casually dating

760
00:47:31,249 --> 00:47:35,738
and that it's not as serious
as you said it was in front of them?

761
00:47:35,762 --> 00:47:38,362
No, I didn't say that to them.

762
00:47:38,386 --> 00:47:41,309
You could have told me that
they didn't know I was coming over.

763
00:47:41,333 --> 00:47:43,362
Or you could have told me
that you gonna make these...

764
00:47:43,386 --> 00:47:47,046
No, it was my joke.
I was the one doing the joke.

765
00:47:47,070 --> 00:47:49,553
Why would I have told you?
Why would I have let you into the joke?

766
00:47:49,577 --> 00:47:51,435
What's...? I'm sorry, what's the joke?

767
00:47:51,459 --> 00:47:56,882
The joke is we're not seriously dating
and you're gonna tell them we are?

768
00:47:56,906 --> 00:48:00,099
"Hey, guys, what if we got married?

769
00:48:00,123 --> 00:48:02,101
"Everybody meet this guy.

770
00:48:02,125 --> 00:48:03,394
"Meet my future husband.

771
00:48:03,418 --> 00:48:07,654
"Oh, PS, I didn't tell you he was coming.
PS, He doesn't even know.

772
00:48:07,678 --> 00:48:14,362
"PPS, This is gonna be the most
awkward five minutes of our lives."

773
00:48:14,386 --> 00:48:17,356
I thought that you would think
it was funny.

774
00:48:17,380 --> 00:48:20,726
I'm not mad. I thought that...

775
00:48:20,750 --> 00:48:22,832
Let's finish the stew.

776
00:48:22,856 --> 00:48:26,279
Next time together we'll play a really,
really good joke on them.

777
00:48:26,303 --> 00:48:30,495
And you can be the joke leader,
you can have the joke idea.

778
00:48:30,519 --> 00:48:34,110
I'll just help you execute the joke.

779
00:48:34,134 --> 00:48:36,735
Well let's hold off a minute
before we start worrying about a next time

780
00:48:36,759 --> 00:48:38,311
we go see your parents.

781
00:49:16,618 --> 00:49:18,803
- Hi, how are you today?
- Good, thank you.

782
00:49:18,827 --> 00:49:21,378
- Do you need help finding something?
- No, thank you.

783
00:49:21,402 --> 00:49:25,500
That jacket looks great on you, by the way.
Just let me know if you need help, okay?

784
00:49:45,335 --> 00:49:46,831
- Did you need a hand?
- No, it's okay.

785
00:49:46,855 --> 00:49:48,707
Did you want us to start
you a changing room?

786
00:49:48,731 --> 00:49:51,474
- No, that's okay.
- Are you sure?

787
00:49:51,498 --> 00:49:54,341
Oh, here.
That jacket is really hard to zip up.

788
00:49:54,365 --> 00:49:57,318
It's okay, I've got it. Thank you.

789
00:49:57,342 --> 00:50:01,576
- Here, I can find a hanger.
- Can you stop following me? Thank you.

790
00:50:01,600 --> 00:50:03,404
I'm sorry, I didn't mean to do that.

791
00:50:05,778 --> 00:50:07,861
Mum, it can't go through the vent!

792
00:50:07,885 --> 00:50:10,686
- Look, Mum!
- You're playing stupid games.

793
00:50:10,710 --> 00:50:13,024
I'm not gonna get caught
up in your stupid games.

794
00:50:13,048 --> 00:50:16,710
Mum! Mum, I'm at home.
This is what people do at home.

795
00:50:16,734 --> 00:50:20,045
They do stupid things.
It's a totally normal thing to do.

796
00:50:20,069 --> 00:50:22,700
Do you really...?
Mum, it's won't catch on fire.

797
00:50:22,724 --> 00:50:24,043
Okay, this is destructive.
Just cut it out.

798
00:50:24,067 --> 00:50:27,371
Look, there's a vent there.
You can't even put it inside.

799
00:50:27,395 --> 00:50:29,820
Look, it's an Anne-proof fireplace.

800
00:50:29,844 --> 00:50:31,834
Nothing bad is gonna happen.

801
00:50:31,858 --> 00:50:34,087
Nothing bad is gonna happen to Anne.
She can...

802
00:50:34,111 --> 00:50:35,748
This is destructive, stop it!

803
00:50:35,772 --> 00:50:37,554
- It's not destructive!
- It's totally destructive!

804
00:50:37,578 --> 00:50:39,505
- It's fake fire!
- Stop it!

805
00:50:39,529 --> 00:50:41,594
It's not gonna catch on fire!

806
00:50:41,618 --> 00:50:43,672
It's not a game.
You're making my behaviour seem...

807
00:50:43,696 --> 00:50:44,847
Are you serious? Look, look!

808
00:50:44,871 --> 00:50:49,435
Stop, stop this!
Okay, can you go sit down?

809
00:50:49,459 --> 00:50:52,067
Why are you being serious about this?

810
00:50:52,091 --> 00:50:54,936
I'm obviously joking around, Mum.
It's a fake fire.

811
00:50:54,960 --> 00:50:56,005
If I stick this in here...

812
00:50:56,029 --> 00:50:59,601
Can we not? Can we not?
You know that it won't catch on fire.

813
00:50:59,625 --> 00:51:02,350
I don't feel good in this house,
I don't feel good around you!

814
00:51:02,374 --> 00:51:05,191
I don't feel good because you don't
understand when I'm making a joke

815
00:51:05,215 --> 00:51:06,660
and you're making this whole deal!

816
00:51:06,684 --> 00:51:08,679
I need to be able to make a joke

817
00:51:08,703 --> 00:51:12,253
without you going and thinking
I'm gonna set the house on fire

818
00:51:12,277 --> 00:51:13,918
- because the whole joke...
- Okay, okay!

819
00:51:13,942 --> 00:51:16,526
I know,
you've explained the joke 400 times.

820
00:51:16,550 --> 00:51:21,012
- You're upset. Just...
- Mum. It's not you, Mum. You're fine.

821
00:51:21,036 --> 00:51:23,219
It's just being in this house.
Like I just don't...

822
00:51:23,243 --> 00:51:26,393
Can we sit?
Can we sit down and just talk?

823
00:51:26,417 --> 00:51:28,391
I'm gonna go home
and I'm just gonna not...

824
00:51:28,415 --> 00:51:30,586
Okay, what if you just stayed tonight?

825
00:51:30,610 --> 00:51:32,282
Mum! No, good night, mum.

826
00:51:32,306 --> 00:51:36,077
No. Don't go, no. Just...

827
00:51:57,250 --> 00:51:58,880
And it's liquidy.

828
00:51:58,904 --> 00:52:02,492
What would a shark eat
out of these three things?

829
00:52:02,516 --> 00:52:05,324
Well, that one is poisonous.
That one is too snappy.

830
00:52:05,348 --> 00:52:06,993
And that one is too...

831
00:52:09,898 --> 00:52:12,972
What's stepping in on your phone?

832
00:52:12,996 --> 00:52:15,531
Matt's being an idiot.

833
00:52:15,555 --> 00:52:17,624
Why? What's been...?

834
00:52:17,648 --> 00:52:22,309
I think he's trying to do some kind of
distancing thing or something like that.

835
00:52:22,333 --> 00:52:24,718
That sucks.

836
00:52:24,742 --> 00:52:27,688
I just don't understand why
he's doing it now, you know?

837
00:52:27,712 --> 00:52:28,926
Yeah.

838
00:52:30,075 --> 00:52:32,064
Things were so normal and friendly.

839
00:52:32,088 --> 00:52:34,321
We can't really talk about this right now.

840
00:52:34,345 --> 00:52:37,753
- It's not the right moment.
- But I mean, if he was answering me,

841
00:52:37,777 --> 00:52:41,111
then I wouldn't feel like I had
to think about it all the time.

842
00:52:41,135 --> 00:52:43,966
Who wants a free hand wash?

843
00:52:43,990 --> 00:52:45,836
Me!

844
00:52:45,860 --> 00:52:49,928
Honestly, the whole time
the relationship's been so romantic

845
00:52:49,952 --> 00:52:52,463
and like so open and so nice

846
00:52:52,487 --> 00:52:54,285
that I never thought
that he was gonna start

847
00:52:54,309 --> 00:52:56,757
pulling any of that kind of stuff,
you know what I mean?

848
00:52:56,781 --> 00:52:58,385
Oh, you got bubbles in your hair.

849
00:52:58,409 --> 00:53:01,609
Treat me like I'm some kind
of weird criminal or something

850
00:53:01,633 --> 00:53:04,445
and he's just gonna start ignoring
all my text messages.

851
00:53:04,469 --> 00:53:09,360
But this isn't the right time to be
even looking at your text messages.

852
00:53:10,481 --> 00:53:12,211
It's distracting because you're not...

853
00:53:12,235 --> 00:53:14,036
you can't be thinking about it
while you're here.

854
00:53:14,060 --> 00:53:17,750
It's not really fair to me. Or anybody.

855
00:53:17,774 --> 00:53:19,460
Whose bowl is this?

856
00:53:22,695 --> 00:53:25,300
You're allowed to tell me
one more thing about sharks

857
00:53:25,324 --> 00:53:27,148
and then you have to go to bed.

858
00:53:31,704 --> 00:53:36,102
Stingray! It's a stingray.

859
00:53:36,126 --> 00:53:40,005
- Stingrays are very beautiful.
- It's a stingray.

860
00:53:40,029 --> 00:53:42,097
Sting, sting, sting, stab.

861
00:53:42,121 --> 00:53:43,937
The stingray buries itself in the sand.

862
00:53:43,961 --> 00:53:45,714
Pop quiz. Pop quiz.

863
00:53:45,738 --> 00:53:48,572
This quiz a hundred percent of your grade.

864
00:53:48,596 --> 00:53:52,076
If you fail you're gonna get
an F minus on your report card.

865
00:53:52,100 --> 00:53:55,313
If I guess the shark right
you have to go to bed.

866
00:53:55,337 --> 00:53:58,089
- Okay.
- A hammerhead shark?

867
00:53:58,113 --> 00:54:00,251
Wrong answer.

868
00:54:00,275 --> 00:54:02,777
- Bull shark?
- Wrong answer.

869
00:54:02,801 --> 00:54:05,833
- You have three more guesses.
- Open mouth shark.

870
00:54:05,857 --> 00:54:07,185
Two.

871
00:54:08,866 --> 00:54:11,482
- You have two and then...
- Great white shark.

872
00:54:11,506 --> 00:54:13,216
One more.

873
00:54:13,240 --> 00:54:14,920
- Whale shark.
- You win.

874
00:54:16,039 --> 00:54:17,059
No!

875
00:54:17,083 --> 00:54:20,397
Baby machine gun. Baby machine gun.

876
00:54:30,847 --> 00:54:32,450
I gave birth to a stingray.

877
00:54:32,474 --> 00:54:34,034
You tried to hold the baby in.

878
00:54:34,058 --> 00:54:35,469
There's more babies I think.

879
00:54:35,493 --> 00:54:38,223
Giving birth to twelve sharks
is very tiring.

880
00:54:57,938 --> 00:55:00,052
- Hey.
- Hi.

881
00:55:01,711 --> 00:55:04,755
- How did it go?
- Good. Thanks.

882
00:55:04,779 --> 00:55:09,320
Did he subject you to the great whites
or the hammerheads tonight?

883
00:55:09,344 --> 00:55:10,781
I don't even remember.

884
00:55:11,913 --> 00:55:13,774
May I?

885
00:55:16,467 --> 00:55:18,361
- Can I top you up?
- Yeah, sure.

886
00:55:23,084 --> 00:55:24,355
Welcome back.

887
00:55:30,902 --> 00:55:33,768
Thanks again for coming out.

888
00:55:33,792 --> 00:55:35,513
Yeah, no problem.

889
00:55:37,426 --> 00:55:41,209
I kept threatening him all week
tell him that if he didn't behave

890
00:55:41,233 --> 00:55:43,956
I was gonna call you and cancel.

891
00:55:47,592 --> 00:55:51,355
Hopefully this is the first
of many of your returns.

892
00:55:52,969 --> 00:55:56,892
Next week I might have another meeting,

893
00:55:56,916 --> 00:55:58,852
Wednesday or Thursday, if you're around.

894
00:56:01,022 --> 00:56:02,568
Okay, thanks.

895
00:56:08,232 --> 00:56:11,152
- What's wrong?
- No, I'm just gonna head home.

896
00:56:11,176 --> 00:56:12,925
You're welcome to stay.
Finish your wine.

897
00:56:12,949 --> 00:56:16,708
That's okay, I had like,
the whole bottle before you got here.

898
00:56:16,732 --> 00:56:18,403
Can I pay you?

899
00:56:18,427 --> 00:56:20,566
You're not working for free.

900
00:56:20,590 --> 00:56:21,734
- Thank you.
- Thank you.

901
00:56:21,758 --> 00:56:23,060
I'll call you about next week?

902
00:56:23,084 --> 00:56:25,606
- Yes. Bye.
- Bye.

903
00:56:27,200 --> 00:56:29,791
Did you tell me you were coming over?
What's going on?

904
00:56:29,815 --> 00:56:32,314
You're a weird little girl, you know that?

905
00:56:32,338 --> 00:56:33,946
What are you doing here?

906
00:56:45,397 --> 00:56:49,751
Sorry. Sorry, sorry, sorry.

907
00:56:51,183 --> 00:56:52,359
Come on.

908
00:56:53,709 --> 00:56:55,186
Hello?

909
00:56:57,910 --> 00:56:59,717
I mean, I made these plans a long time ago

910
00:56:59,741 --> 00:57:02,884
maybe if you'd given me more notice
I could have shifted things around.

911
00:57:02,908 --> 00:57:04,902
But, I'm sorry.

912
00:57:06,450 --> 00:57:08,075
Excuse me?

913
00:57:13,624 --> 00:57:16,380
- What's up?
- I have to go to work.

914
00:57:16,404 --> 00:57:17,950
Dammit.

915
00:57:17,974 --> 00:57:19,537
You said you had the day off.

916
00:57:19,561 --> 00:57:21,823
Someone called and asked me
to take their shift.

917
00:57:21,847 --> 00:57:23,662
Can you drive me?

918
00:57:23,686 --> 00:57:26,696
- How far is it?
- Never mind, it's fine.

919
00:57:26,720 --> 00:57:29,241
I'm trying to tease you.
I'm saying yes, I'm driving you. Come on.

920
00:57:29,265 --> 00:57:31,804
You ready for your first day of daycare?

921
00:57:31,828 --> 00:57:34,780
The other kids I think
are gonna be really nice.

922
00:57:34,804 --> 00:57:37,638
Trust me, I talked to some
of the other parents,

923
00:57:37,662 --> 00:57:39,990
they said that they specialise
in kids like you.

924
00:57:40,014 --> 00:57:41,536
You don't like going to daycare?

925
00:57:45,014 --> 00:57:48,231
- You're really fast.
- Well you said you were late.

926
00:57:56,169 --> 00:57:57,696
Thank you for driving me.

927
00:57:57,720 --> 00:57:59,717
Don't worry about it.

928
00:58:02,122 --> 00:58:03,259
Nyree, I'm here.

929
00:58:03,283 --> 00:58:06,190
- Hey, hey good. Thank you.
- Yeah.

930
00:58:06,214 --> 00:58:08,749
Yeah, but you supposed to be here
half an hour ago.

931
00:58:08,773 --> 00:58:10,793
I mean you just called me
and I came all the way across town.

932
00:58:10,817 --> 00:58:12,169
I came as fast as I could.

933
00:58:12,193 --> 00:58:13,629
Okay, you know what thank you.

934
00:58:13,653 --> 00:58:16,173
Why don't you go home,
I'll take over your class.

935
00:58:16,197 --> 00:58:17,595
- Great.
- Great.

936
00:58:17,619 --> 00:58:19,724
You signed in though right?

937
00:58:19,748 --> 00:58:22,596
No, I'll sign in when I go
past the office later, it's fine.

938
00:58:22,620 --> 00:58:26,809
Actually, it's not fine.
Just go sign in while I'm still here.

939
00:58:26,833 --> 00:58:30,771
Sign in really,
really quick and just come right back.

940
00:58:30,795 --> 00:58:33,373
R-E-D. Red. R-E-D.

941
00:58:34,674 --> 00:58:36,914
- Is this not the sign-out?
- No. Remember we changed it?

942
00:58:37,969 --> 00:58:41,378
I went over that in the staff meeting
the other day.

943
00:58:41,402 --> 00:58:43,897
Then it's important that
you read the message book

944
00:58:43,921 --> 00:58:45,994
so you know what kids are away
and who's...

945
00:58:46,018 --> 00:58:49,804
- What's that say?
- That's Autumn and Rain's nanny.

946
00:59:14,672 --> 00:59:16,909
Hi, you shoe.

947
00:59:19,301 --> 00:59:20,446
Excuse me.

948
00:59:20,470 --> 00:59:22,157
Isaiah, guys, stay in the classroom.

949
00:59:24,766 --> 00:59:27,046
Okay, alright. I'm signed in.

950
00:59:27,070 --> 00:59:29,166
Thank you. Thank you very much.

951
00:59:29,190 --> 00:59:32,325
Guys, be good.
I will see you later, okay?

952
00:59:32,349 --> 00:59:34,209
Okay. Bye.

953
00:59:34,233 --> 00:59:36,604
- Bye.
- Bye.

954
00:59:36,628 --> 00:59:40,466
Can you guys please put these away?

955
00:59:40,490 --> 00:59:41,592
If you want you can go to your cubbies,

956
00:59:41,616 --> 00:59:43,792
you can get your show-and-tell
that you were going to bring today.

957
00:59:43,816 --> 00:59:45,159
- Yes!
- Yes!

958
00:59:45,183 --> 00:59:46,685
Oliver.

959
00:59:48,634 --> 00:59:52,144
You guys each get a basket,
don't let anyone see your show and tell.

960
00:59:52,168 --> 00:59:54,354
So we went to the zoo

961
00:59:54,378 --> 00:59:57,838
and one of my favourite
animals there was a tiger

962
00:59:57,862 --> 01:00:00,193
because they're amazing animals

963
01:00:00,217 --> 01:00:04,907
and one of my favourite animals
that you can actually have as a pet

964
01:00:04,931 --> 01:00:09,453
is a cat and a tiger is a species of cat.

965
01:00:09,477 --> 01:00:10,496
That's awesome.

966
01:00:10,520 --> 01:00:12,472
What's inside mystical box number one?

967
01:00:12,496 --> 01:00:14,230
Is that a cat collar?

968
01:00:14,254 --> 01:00:19,117
Yeah. This was the collar
for my cat Spiky.

969
01:00:19,141 --> 01:00:21,780
So basically what happened was...

970
01:00:22,957 --> 01:00:29,014
we had a thermometer
in the backyard of my house

971
01:00:29,038 --> 01:00:33,274
and it broke when nobody was home

972
01:00:33,298 --> 01:00:36,396
and my little cat Spiky

973
01:00:36,420 --> 01:00:39,489
licked up all the mercury.

974
01:00:40,605 --> 01:00:45,197
So when we came home we
couldn't get him to stop moving.

975
01:00:45,221 --> 01:00:48,070
He was just running back and forth

976
01:00:48,094 --> 01:00:50,824
and eventually he escaped out the window

977
01:00:52,144 --> 01:00:54,473
until you couldn't hear the bell any more.

978
01:00:57,751 --> 01:01:01,383
So my dad had to go up
onto the roof and get him down.

979
01:01:04,107 --> 01:01:06,934
Was the cat okay?

980
01:01:06,958 --> 01:01:09,069
No, he died.

981
01:01:09,093 --> 01:01:12,338
Yeah, she said she had a cat.

982
01:01:12,362 --> 01:01:14,129
Had.

983
01:01:14,153 --> 01:01:16,979
- Was his mind messed up?
- Yeah.

984
01:01:17,003 --> 01:01:18,939
Wouldn't you take him to a vet?

985
01:01:18,963 --> 01:01:20,779
We couldn't catch him.

986
01:01:20,803 --> 01:01:22,788
Couldn't you lure him in with food?

987
01:01:22,812 --> 01:01:27,114
No, couldn't lure him in with food,
Oliver, because he went crazy.

988
01:01:27,138 --> 01:01:29,533
He ate a poison that made
him go completely crazy.

989
01:01:29,557 --> 01:01:31,786
Maybe he was thirsty.

990
01:01:33,787 --> 01:01:35,769
That was funny.

991
01:01:37,904 --> 01:01:40,842
Well it couldn't have been your fault
because you weren't there.

992
01:01:48,492 --> 01:01:52,018
You are now queen of the world.

993
01:01:52,042 --> 01:01:54,424
And now you're queen of mercury.

994
01:02:15,182 --> 01:02:18,957
Anne? Can you get that for me please?

995
01:02:18,981 --> 01:02:21,634
I can't get it for you right now.

996
01:02:25,793 --> 01:02:28,286
Come here. Come here.

997
01:02:30,051 --> 01:02:32,001
I cannot with both your arms.

998
01:02:33,030 --> 01:02:34,813
Peacemaker.

999
01:02:39,071 --> 01:02:40,557
Anne.

1000
01:02:47,719 --> 01:02:49,818
I'm like a butterfly. I emerged.

1001
01:02:51,387 --> 01:02:55,167
Arms then I think it's in the stomach.

1002
01:02:59,286 --> 01:03:01,372
Anne, come see my trick.

1003
01:03:05,081 --> 01:03:06,687
Anne.

1004
01:03:12,441 --> 01:03:13,888
Anne?

1005
01:03:17,242 --> 01:03:19,335
Hey, what's going on?

1006
01:03:24,209 --> 01:03:26,813
It's okay.
I think she has a stomach ache.

1007
01:03:28,095 --> 01:03:30,249
Do you want to get some fresh air?

1008
01:03:53,367 --> 01:03:54,908
Anne?

1009
01:03:58,109 --> 01:03:59,720
Can you hear me?

1010
01:04:05,430 --> 01:04:07,112
Are you okay?

1011
01:04:15,514 --> 01:04:17,649
You're okay. It's okay.

1012
01:04:19,899 --> 01:04:22,228
We'll just go home, okay?
We'll just go home.

1013
01:04:36,388 --> 01:04:38,722
Where are we going?

1014
01:04:38,746 --> 01:04:42,268
I just thought we would stop
by your mum's house for a second,

1015
01:04:42,292 --> 01:04:43,722
since we're in the neighbourhood.

1016
01:04:43,746 --> 01:04:45,297
What did you say to her?

1017
01:04:45,321 --> 01:04:49,741
I talked to her just briefly
and she was totally cool about it.

1018
01:04:49,765 --> 01:04:51,373
She wasn't...

1019
01:04:51,397 --> 01:04:54,077
- Fuck this.
- Sorry.

1020
01:04:57,473 --> 01:05:00,618
- She's not gonna...
- I don't want to go to her house.

1021
01:05:00,642 --> 01:05:04,102
I know you don't want to see her
but I think I need a little bit of help.

1022
01:05:04,126 --> 01:05:06,056
I want to get out of the car.

1023
01:05:07,070 --> 01:05:11,478
- I want to get out of the car.
- I'll pull over in a second if you want.

1024
01:05:11,502 --> 01:05:14,280
Anne, what the fuck are you doing?

1025
01:05:20,287 --> 01:05:23,021
What the fuck? Close the door.

1026
01:05:23,045 --> 01:05:24,591
Jesus.

1027
01:05:25,699 --> 01:05:27,355
Anne.

1028
01:05:52,569 --> 01:05:54,650
Good morning.

1029
01:05:54,674 --> 01:05:56,605
Good morning, Nathan.

1030
01:06:11,778 --> 01:06:13,686
Wait, that's your foot.

1031
01:06:13,710 --> 01:06:16,137
Can I see your car?

1032
01:06:16,161 --> 01:06:20,260
This is the green car.

1033
01:06:20,284 --> 01:06:22,184
The green car?

1034
01:06:22,208 --> 01:06:24,199
Do you want to make the car drive?

1035
01:06:29,248 --> 01:06:32,350
That's my car but I think you should go.

1036
01:06:36,027 --> 01:06:39,050
I got a red car.

1037
01:06:39,074 --> 01:06:40,427
Red car?

1038
01:06:40,451 --> 01:06:42,600
It's all red there.

1039
01:06:52,569 --> 01:06:56,026
Red is my favourite colour.

1040
01:06:56,050 --> 01:07:00,754
- Really?
- I just have the green one... them.

1041
01:07:02,721 --> 01:07:05,023
Do you know what sound a police car makes?

1042
01:07:13,454 --> 01:07:15,272
It's got good wheels.

1043
01:07:21,328 --> 01:07:23,495
Nice. You're doing it.

1044
01:07:23,519 --> 01:07:26,254
There you go.

1045
01:07:26,278 --> 01:07:28,376
I clouded you out.

1046
01:07:28,400 --> 01:07:30,511
- There you go.
- Good job.

1047
01:07:30,535 --> 01:07:32,657
She's getting it. She's got it.

1048
01:07:32,681 --> 01:07:34,796
- We get it, you vape.
- You vape.

1049
01:07:34,820 --> 01:07:36,721
- Cheers guys.
- Cheers.

1050
01:07:39,807 --> 01:07:41,111
Are you nervous?

1051
01:07:44,162 --> 01:07:46,482
You're excited though yeah? Right on.

1052
01:07:46,506 --> 01:07:49,152
And what are we gonna do?

1053
01:07:49,176 --> 01:07:52,109
- Classic arch.
- Classic arch.

1054
01:07:52,133 --> 01:07:54,081
- That was beautiful.
- Perfect.

1055
01:07:54,105 --> 01:07:55,684
Sharing is caring.

1056
01:07:57,156 --> 01:08:00,299
You should always do a gainer.
Always do a gainer.

1057
01:08:00,323 --> 01:08:04,080
- Gainer and track.
- Absolutely, all the time.

1058
01:08:04,104 --> 01:08:05,854
Feeling it?

1059
01:08:07,186 --> 01:08:09,434
She's getting into it.

1060
01:08:09,458 --> 01:08:11,737
Little head rush?

1061
01:08:11,761 --> 01:08:14,607
Little bit. Little head rush
before you feel the real rush?

1062
01:08:14,631 --> 01:08:18,780
- You guys do this before and after?
- I just do it all day.

1063
01:08:18,804 --> 01:08:22,020
Arch. Reach and pull.

1064
01:08:22,044 --> 01:08:24,364
Slap it and tap it.

1065
01:08:24,388 --> 01:08:26,112
You gotta put the hang loose up.

1066
01:08:26,136 --> 01:08:29,159
Boom boom, I'm not even looking at you.

1067
01:08:30,622 --> 01:08:32,510
We'll have him behind the pilot.

1068
01:08:33,689 --> 01:08:35,062
I'll give you a hand.
