<i>When I was diagnosed
with this virus,</i>

9
00:00:59,158 --> 00:01:00,759
<i>it didn't take me long
to realize</i>

10
00:01:00,792 --> 00:01:03,295
<i>I'd contracted
a diseased society as well.</i>

11
00:01:19,378 --> 00:01:21,114
<i>It could be construed
as critical,</i>

12
00:01:21,147 --> 00:01:22,849
<i>but if you're doing
a show of AIDS,</i>

13
00:01:22,882 --> 00:01:24,784
<i>there's absolutely no way
that you can separate</i>

14
00:01:24,816 --> 00:01:26,551

15

<i>East Germany today

18
00:01:31,724 --> 00:01:33,593
<i>Bottom line
is I may be dying of AIDS</i>

<i>in America in 1989.</i>

20
00:01:35,260 --> 00:01:37,229
<i>Isn't that political?</i>

21
00:01:37,263 --> 00:01:39,132
<i>I don't have health insurance
and that I don't have</i>

22
00:01:39,165 --> 00:01:40,800
<i>economic access

23
00:01:40,832 --> 00:01:42,868
<i>Isn't that political?</i>

24
00:01:42,902 --> 00:01:45,638
<i>And to try to pretend
that the subject of AIDS</i>

25
00:01:45,671 --> 00:01:50,343
<i>cannot have a political tinge

26
00:01:50,376 --> 00:01:52,210

- <i>You're gonna make art</i>

<i>The chairman

<i>"We find that a large portion

41
00:02:21,840 --> 00:02:23,776
<i>Some of the content
includes criticism</i>

42
00:02:23,808 --> 00:02:26,444
<i>of Cardinal O'Connor,

<i>of California,

45
00:02:31,516 --> 00:02:34,686
<i>Thank you. This weather

<i>So are you gonna do
Nightline tonight?</i>

47
00:02:36,521 --> 00:02:39,724
<i>Uh, I somehow just can't
see it. I mean, I...</i>

48
00:02:39,758 --> 00:02:41,661
<i>Do you think you'd put on
a shirt if you did?</i>

49
00:02:41,693 --> 00:02:42,894
<i>Well, that's what
I was thinking of already,</i>

50
00:02:42,927 --> 00:02:44,697
<i>my wardrobe.</i>

51
00:02:44,729 --> 00:02:48,600
<i>I mean, I... if I did,
I might wear a ski mask</i>

52
00:02:48,633 --> 00:02:50,835
<i>and I'll, you know,</i>

53
00:02:50,868 --> 00:02:53,639
<i>carry a bucket of gasoline.</i>

<i>The art
of David Wojnarowicz</i>

56
00:03:00,412 --> 00:03:02,682
<i>has recently been
at the center of controversy</i>

57
00:03:02,715 --> 00:03:06,885
<i>because the subject matter
deals with sexuality and AIDS.</i>

58
00:03:06,919 --> 00:03:08,820
<i>Let's talk about
how you started making art.</i>

59
00:03:08,854 --> 00:03:11,257
<i>Now, you came from a really
rough family background.</i>

60
00:03:11,289 --> 00:03:12,959
<i>Your father abused your mother.</i>

61
00:03:12,991 --> 00:03:14,926
<i>You ended up in an orphanage
for a while.</i>

62
00:03:14,960 --> 00:03:17,629
<i>Then your father kidnapped you
from the orphanage.</i>

63
00:03:17,663 --> 00:03:19,731
<i>And you've written
that you later threw yourself</i>

64
00:03:19,764 --> 00:03:22,334
<i>into sex and you became
a hustler for a while.</i>

65
00:03:22,367 --> 00:03:23,969
<i>How did you start
making art?</i>

66
00:03:29,508 --> 00:03:31,711
<i>Whatever work I've done,
it's always been informed</i>

67
00:03:31,743 --> 00:03:35,281
<i>by what I experienced
as an American in this country,</i>

68
00:03:35,313 --> 00:03:37,483
<i>as a homosexual
in this country,</i>

69
00:03:37,515 --> 00:03:40,652
<i>as a person who's legislated
into silence in this country.</i>

70
00:03:40,686 --> 00:03:43,990
<i>One, two, three, four,
civil rights or civil war?</i>

71
00:03:44,022 --> 00:03:46,324
<i>I'm not gonna be polite,
and fuck these people</i>

72
00:03:46,358 --> 00:03:48,294
<i>that want me
to be courageous.</i>

73
00:03:48,326 --> 00:03:50,862
<i>There's no expression
in that other than silence.</i>

74
00:03:50,895 --> 00:03:53,265
<i>As each T cell
disappears from my body,</i>

75
00:03:53,299 --> 00:03:57,436
<i>it's replaced by 10 pounds
of pressure, 10 pounds of rage.</i>

76
00:03:57,468 --> 00:03:59,337
<i>I tried very hard to be normal</i>

77
00:03:59,371 --> 00:04:01,307
<i>and tried very hard
to be accepted.</i>

78
00:04:01,340 --> 00:04:03,542
<i>On some level,
it's a terrific waste of time.</i>

79
00:04:05,576 --> 00:04:07,280
- <i>Wojnarowicz?</i>
- <i>Wojnarowicz.</i>

80
00:04:07,312 --> 00:04:08,446
- <i>Wojnarowicz.</i>
- <i>Wojnarowicz.</i>

81
00:04:08,479 --> 00:04:10,917
<i>Fuck you faggot fucker.</i>

82
00:04:18,423 --> 00:04:19,959
<i>David was two years younger</i>

83
00:04:19,992 --> 00:04:22,962
<i>than me, and Pat
was sort of the big girl.</i>

84
00:04:22,995 --> 00:04:26,465
<i>I don't remember him
ever aspiring to do art,</i>

85
00:04:26,497 --> 00:04:28,067
<i>or to be a doctor,
or a lawyer,</i>

86
00:04:28,100 --> 00:04:29,769
<i>or anything else.</i>

87
00:04:29,802 --> 00:04:31,470
<i>I think we were probably
too consumed</i>

88
00:04:31,502 --> 00:04:33,538
<i>with trying to survive
in any given moment</i>

89
00:04:33,572 --> 00:04:37,343
<i>than to be worried about
what was going down the road.</i>

90
00:04:37,375 --> 00:04:39,644
<i>Dave and I
used to go out in the woods.</i>

91
00:04:39,677 --> 00:04:41,747
<i>We'd get away from my father.</i>

92
00:04:41,779 --> 00:04:44,716
<i>He was horrific
when he was drunk.</i>

93
00:04:44,750 --> 00:04:46,519
<i>I grew up in a tiny
version of hell</i>

94
00:04:46,552 --> 00:04:48,354
<i>called the suburbs.</i>

95
00:04:48,387 --> 00:04:50,488
<i>I had a father who brutalized
both his first and second wives</i>

96
00:04:50,521 --> 00:04:52,358
<i>with physical violence.</i>

97
00:04:52,391 --> 00:04:54,093
<i>Any signs of life
in the family he supported</i>

98
00:04:54,125 --> 00:04:56,628
<i>with his paycheck
from his job as a sailor</i>

99
00:04:56,661 --> 00:04:58,563
<i>was met with extreme violence.</i>

100
00:04:58,596 --> 00:05:00,699
<i>In the universe of the forest,</i>

101
00:05:00,733 --> 00:05:02,500
<i>I didn't think of what it felt
like as a five or six-year-old</i>

102
00:05:02,533 --> 00:05:04,103
<i>being dragged
down a basement stair,</i>

103
00:05:04,136 --> 00:05:06,739
<i>to have my head and body
hit with a dog chain</i>

104
00:05:06,771 --> 00:05:08,940
<i>or a sawed-off chunk of 2x4.</i>

105
00:05:08,973 --> 00:05:12,944
<i>In my home, one cannot laugh,
one cannot express boredom,</i>

106
00:05:12,978 --> 00:05:16,749
<i>one cannot cry, one cannot
play, one cannot explore,</i>

107
00:05:16,781 --> 00:05:18,616
<i>one cannot engage
in any activity</i>

108
00:05:18,649 --> 00:05:21,586
<i>that showed development
or growth that was independent.</i>

109
00:05:33,165 --> 00:05:35,367
<i>This life on the streets</i>

110
00:05:35,401 --> 00:05:39,504
<i>got really rough and David
ended up in a halfway house.</i>

111
00:05:39,538 --> 00:05:43,042
<i>He had not graduated
from high school at that point.</i>

112
00:05:43,074 --> 00:05:44,843
<i>When he finally went back
to school</i>

113
00:05:44,877 --> 00:05:47,612
<i>was when he discovered
Rimbaud and Genet.</i>

114
00:05:47,646 --> 00:05:50,816
<i>They both
are outlaws and rebels.</i>

115
00:05:50,848 --> 00:05:54,954
<i>and he always identified
with outsiders his whole life</i>

116
00:05:54,987 --> 00:05:59,391
<i>and these
were the outsider writers.</i>

117
00:06:04,730 --> 00:06:07,633
<i>Testing tape journal,
one, two, three.</i>

118
00:06:21,846 --> 00:06:23,415
<i>So, it looks like
we ended up</i>

119
00:06:23,449 --> 00:06:26,419
<i>in Jamestown, North Dakota.</i>

120
00:06:26,451 --> 00:06:29,422
<i>That's the halfway mark
between east and west.</i>

121
00:06:34,759 --> 00:06:37,495
<i>Feels like something
out of an old west picture,</i>

122
00:06:37,528 --> 00:06:40,699
<i>dusty roads
and old board buildings,</i>

123
00:06:40,732 --> 00:06:43,169
<i>little family houses
all around you,</i>

124
00:06:43,201 --> 00:06:48,007
<i>great stretches of sky,
long lines of trains.</i>

125
00:06:48,040 --> 00:06:51,043
<i>The tracks, when you look
at them, just shimmer.</i>

126
00:06:51,076 --> 00:06:54,447
<i>It looks like thousands of
little animals running across.</i>

127
00:06:54,480 --> 00:06:57,016
<i>Then there's the constant
flapping of bird wings</i>

128
00:06:57,048 --> 00:07:00,786
<i>like</i>.

129
00:07:03,788 --> 00:07:06,591
<i>Occasionally, you hear a train
whistling miles away,</i>

130
00:07:06,625 --> 00:07:10,495
<i>but the trains
never seem to get here.</i>

131
00:07:19,805 --> 00:07:23,042
<i>That was doggie French
for, "Hi, pinheads."</i>

132
00:07:23,074 --> 00:07:25,043
<i>I'm just sitting here
in my sister's apartment</i>

133
00:07:25,076 --> 00:07:27,045
<i>using her tape recorder,
trying to figure out</i>

134
00:07:27,079 --> 00:07:28,980
<i>what the hell to say.</i>

135
00:07:33,685 --> 00:07:35,987
<i>As far as publishing,
forget it.</i>

136
00:07:36,021 --> 00:07:38,157
<i>The last woman
that I sent the manuscript to,</i>

137
00:07:38,189 --> 00:07:40,992
<i>this woman in Black Sun,
Le Soleil Noir,</i>

138
00:07:41,026 --> 00:07:43,062
<i>called me up like after a month
and told me</i>

139
00:07:43,095 --> 00:07:45,564
<i>she wanted to return
my manuscript.</i>

140
00:07:45,596 --> 00:07:47,233
<i>You know, she said that
the people in the monologues</i>

141
00:07:47,266 --> 00:07:49,535
<i>are wasted lives
and it was a waste of time</i>

142
00:07:49,567 --> 00:07:51,036
<i>to write about them.</i>

143
00:07:51,069 --> 00:07:52,905
<i>I mean, everything she said</i>

144
00:07:52,937 --> 00:07:56,241
<i>just reinforced my belief
of its importance.</i>

145
00:07:56,274 --> 00:07:58,911
<i>It's like that. I mean,
it's like the galleries, too.</i>

146
00:07:58,944 --> 00:08:01,180
<i>The stuff that I work on
takes so long to do</i>

147
00:08:01,213 --> 00:08:03,115
<i>that the price
that I'd have to ask</i>

148
00:08:03,148 --> 00:08:05,751
<i>if I was gonna make a living
off is just too much</i>

149
00:08:05,783 --> 00:08:07,552
<i>especially
since her tastes gravitate</i>

150
00:08:07,586 --> 00:08:10,990
<i>towards Woolworthian prints.</i>

151
00:08:11,023 --> 00:08:12,858
<i>I've been having,
like, just tons and tons</i>

152
00:08:12,891 --> 00:08:17,263
<i>of dreams of America
and American road and highways.</i>

153
00:08:17,295 --> 00:08:19,865
<i>I really miss
the energy in New York.</i>

154
00:08:19,898 --> 00:08:22,935
<i>Paris gives you a sense
of strange security,</i>

155
00:08:22,968 --> 00:08:24,870
<i>which does make me happy.</i>

156
00:08:24,903 --> 00:08:26,838
<i>So, I guess
I'll say goodbye here.</i>

157
00:08:32,076 --> 00:08:33,578
<i>Bye-bye.</i>

158
00:08:57,168 --> 00:08:59,904
<i>I was doing a series
of photographs</i>

159
00:08:59,937 --> 00:09:01,973
<i>of Arthur Rimbaud
in New York.</i>

160
00:09:03,908 --> 00:09:05,811
<i>I got a job
in an ad agency</i>

161
00:09:05,844 --> 00:09:07,580
<i>for all of
two and a half weeks,</i>

162
00:09:07,613 --> 00:09:09,081
<i>operating a stat machine.</i>

163
00:09:09,114 --> 00:09:10,883
<i>Then I ended up
doing all my own work.</i>

164
00:09:16,955 --> 00:09:20,359
<i>I statted this face of
Arthur Rimbaud, blew it up,</i>

165
00:09:20,392 --> 00:09:24,830
<i>and made a flat mask,
I'm riding subways</i>

166
00:09:24,863 --> 00:09:26,899
<i>wandering all through
the warehouses,</i>

167
00:09:26,932 --> 00:09:28,967
<i>hustling in Times Square.</i>

168
00:09:31,269 --> 00:09:33,238
<i>David was taking Rimbaud</i>

169
00:09:33,270 --> 00:09:36,274
<i>through what was his world
in New York.</i>

170
00:09:38,243 --> 00:09:40,613
<i>Come on, man. Come on.</i>

171
00:09:40,645 --> 00:09:42,046
<i>I grew up as a hustler.</i>

172
00:09:42,080 --> 00:09:44,083
<i>I grew up hustling
in Times Square</i>

173
00:09:44,115 --> 00:09:47,251
<i>and all sorts of places
all around New York.</i>

174
00:09:47,284 --> 00:09:49,721
<i>Men of all different
descriptions.</i>

175
00:10:07,905 --> 00:10:09,807
<i>By the time I got
off the streets</i>

176
00:10:09,841 --> 00:10:12,977
<i>when I was about 17 or 18,
I had to turn to making things</i>

177
00:10:13,010 --> 00:10:15,813
<i>because I basically
could never find a place</i>

178
00:10:15,846 --> 00:10:19,150
<i>to ever express
what I had experienced.</i>

179
00:10:19,183 --> 00:10:21,153
<i>I remember one of
the most emotional experiences</i>

180
00:10:21,186 --> 00:10:24,956
<i>was one day being picked up
by this guy who was very creepy</i>

181
00:10:24,990 --> 00:10:27,326
<i>and I remember lying
on this dirty bed.</i>

182
00:10:27,359 --> 00:10:29,061
<i>It was one of these
cheap hotels.</i>

183
00:10:29,094 --> 00:10:31,897
<i>And this guy
was sucking my dick,</i>

184
00:10:31,929 --> 00:10:34,298
<i>his mouth was sticky,
and that he would kiss my leg</i>

185
00:10:34,331 --> 00:10:36,031
<i>and there would be
like this gummy</i>

186
00:10:36,033 --> 00:10:38,003
<i>kind of stuff on my leg.</i>

187
00:10:38,035 --> 00:10:40,338
<i>And it was all this stuff
that I was really repulsed by</i>

188
00:10:40,371 --> 00:10:42,674
<i>and not enough to not have
a hard on.</i>

189
00:10:42,707 --> 00:10:44,142
<i>I remember feeling all this</i>

190
00:10:44,176 --> 00:10:45,277
<i>incredible emotion
for this guy.</i>

191
00:10:45,309 --> 00:10:47,078
<i>I just felt so sad for him.</i>

192
00:10:47,111 --> 00:10:49,014
<i>At some point, I, like,
reached under his arms,</i>

193
00:10:49,047 --> 00:10:51,417
<i>and pulled him up to me,
and kissed him on the mouth,</i>

194
00:10:51,450 --> 00:10:53,919
<i>which is the thing
that I least wanted to do.</i>

195
00:10:53,951 --> 00:10:56,154
<i>He started weeping
and just said,</i>

196
00:10:56,187 --> 00:10:58,756
<i>"Nobody's ever done that."
And ended up giving me</i>

197
00:10:58,789 --> 00:11:01,959
<i>extra money, whatever,
which I was quite happy with.</i>

198
00:11:11,970 --> 00:11:13,038
<i>It's like a whole
experience</i>

199
00:11:13,071 --> 00:11:15,074
<i>living on the streets</i>

200
00:11:15,106 --> 00:11:17,308
<i>when I ran away from home
of feeling the world's setup</i>

201
00:11:17,341 --> 00:11:21,980
<i>in such a way that it seems
that I'm constantly working</i>

202
00:11:22,013 --> 00:11:25,484
<i>against it
rather than alongside.</i>

203
00:11:28,854 --> 00:11:30,422
<i>Most guys that I meet,</i>

204
00:11:30,455 --> 00:11:32,357
<i>their lives are just
so completely different.</i>

205
00:11:32,389 --> 00:11:34,460
<i>You know,
there's no real communication</i>

206
00:11:34,493 --> 00:11:37,329
<i>where I can feel totally free
in expressing my ideas</i>

207
00:11:37,361 --> 00:11:40,498
<i>or my desires
or my experiences.</i>

208
00:11:40,532 --> 00:11:42,868
<i>My experience
as a hustler seems to be</i>

209
00:11:42,900 --> 00:11:45,003
<i>one thing that sits
on the back of my shoulder.</i>

210
00:11:48,974 --> 00:11:50,943
<i>One thing that's
incredibly hard to convey</i>

211
00:11:50,975 --> 00:11:54,312
<i>to people is the level
of promiscuity of that era.</i>

212
00:11:54,346 --> 00:11:56,014
<i>This is something
that's really hard</i>

213
00:11:56,047 --> 00:11:57,349
<i>to describe to people
who are younger.</i>

214
00:11:57,381 --> 00:11:59,417
<i>We thought sex
was good for you.</i>

215
00:11:59,451 --> 00:12:01,920
<i>That what was bad for you
is not having sex.</i>

216
00:12:01,952 --> 00:12:04,155
<i>And then what was bad for you
is repression of sexuality,</i>

217
00:12:04,188 --> 00:12:06,024
<i>that was bad.</i>

218
00:12:06,057 --> 00:12:08,894
<i>This is before AIDS or before
we were aware of AIDS.</i>

219
00:12:16,134 --> 00:12:17,836
<i>I grew up
in North Carolina.</i>

220
00:12:17,869 --> 00:12:20,072
<i>And when I first moved
to the East Village...</i>

221
00:12:20,105 --> 00:12:21,974
<i>Smoke, smoke.</i>

222
00:12:22,006 --> 00:12:23,941
<i>...it was cliche things
you see in the movies</i>

223
00:12:23,975 --> 00:12:28,213
<i>of drug-dealing places,
dealers standing around</i>

224
00:12:28,245 --> 00:12:31,115
<i>selling coke and dope,
coke and dope, C&D, C&D.</i>

225
00:12:34,552 --> 00:12:36,955
- <i>real slow, brother.
I said real slow.</i>

226
00:12:36,988 --> 00:12:38,891
- <i>I'll sell that bullshit.</i>
- <i>That is bullshit.</i>

227
00:12:38,923 --> 00:12:40,358
<i>People forget
how much the rest</i>

228
00:12:40,392 --> 00:12:42,361
<i>of America hated New York.</i>

229
00:12:42,394 --> 00:12:44,797
<i>We were a bunch of junkies
and cocksuckers</i>

230
00:12:44,830 --> 00:12:47,099
<i>as far as America
was concerned, and, you know,</i>

231
00:12:47,131 --> 00:12:48,866
<i>there's a real sense
of culture decline.</i>

232
00:12:51,503 --> 00:12:53,405
<i>There had been
this huge shift</i>

233
00:12:53,437 --> 00:12:56,441
<i>between the kind of idealisms
of the '60s</i>

234
00:12:56,474 --> 00:12:58,310
<i>and the first
Civil Rights Movement,</i>

235
00:12:58,342 --> 00:13:00,111
<i>the anti-war movement.</i>

236
00:13:00,144 --> 00:13:03,215
<i>All these things
had derailed by the mid-70s.</i>

237
00:13:03,248 --> 00:13:06,252
<i>And so we were responding
to that in different ways.</i>

238
00:13:13,524 --> 00:13:15,927
<i>I walked up to the park,
and the streets</i>

239
00:13:15,961 --> 00:13:20,832
<i>were completely empty,
and traffic was nonexistent.</i>

240
00:13:20,865 --> 00:13:24,569
<i>I had opened up my pants</i>

241
00:13:24,602 --> 00:13:26,572
<i>and I walked up
and down the pathways,</i>

242
00:13:26,605 --> 00:13:29,074
<i>and there's just, like,
this really quiet</i>

243
00:13:29,106 --> 00:13:31,876
<i>sort of loneliness there.</i>

244
00:13:31,909 --> 00:13:33,377
<i>I mean, I felt like
I was, like,</i>

245
00:13:33,410 --> 00:13:35,480
<i>you know, back where
I'd started from.</i>

246
00:13:37,615 --> 00:13:39,350
<i>I've been filled
with this sense</i>

247
00:13:39,384 --> 00:13:43,622
<i>of, uh, of anxiousness,</i>

248
00:13:43,654 --> 00:13:47,592
<i>and the fact that I'm 26,
I'm thinking about myself</i>

249
00:13:47,625 --> 00:13:51,096
<i>and my values, my actions,
and thinking about the effect</i>

250
00:13:51,129 --> 00:13:53,498
<i>of people on people,
wondering if any</i>

251
00:13:53,530 --> 00:13:56,968
<i>of it's meaningful,
if it's futile,</i>

252
00:13:57,001 --> 00:13:59,503
<i>trying to figure out what it is
that my life is,</i>

253
00:13:59,537 --> 00:14:01,407
<i>and where I've been going.</i>

254
00:14:05,043 --> 00:14:07,144
<i>This is a man
whose time has come,</i>

255
00:14:07,177 --> 00:14:09,981
<i>a man whose principles
have been familiar to Americans</i>

256
00:14:10,014 --> 00:14:12,516
<i>for 30 years,
a man whose accomplishments</i>

257
00:14:12,549 --> 00:14:14,519
<i>make him the natural choice</i>

258
00:14:14,552 --> 00:14:17,122
<i>for president
of the United States.</i>

259
00:14:17,154 --> 00:14:21,326
<i>We will make
America great again.</i>

260
00:14:21,359 --> 00:14:22,494
<i>Thank you very much.</i>

261
00:14:25,163 --> 00:14:28,634
<i>Reagan, as the president
of this country now,</i>

262
00:14:28,667 --> 00:14:31,570
<i>going through a time in my life
that seems desperate,</i>

263
00:14:31,602 --> 00:14:36,107
<i>surreal, awful, and slightly
wondrous all simultaneously.</i>

264
00:14:38,677 --> 00:14:42,247
<i>Met a fellow a month
or so ago, Peter Hujar,</i>

265
00:14:42,279 --> 00:14:45,384
<i>photographer who,
in some interesting ways,</i>

266
00:14:45,417 --> 00:14:49,153
<i>is like a mirror
of scenes I'm entering.</i>

267
00:14:49,187 --> 00:14:54,993
<i>He has the same desperate
and at times confused outlook,</i>

268
00:14:55,025 --> 00:14:58,496
<i>but minus the one seed
of hope that I have in me.</i>

269
00:15:04,970 --> 00:15:08,273
<i>The relationship
between Peter and David</i>

270
00:15:08,306 --> 00:15:12,009
<i>is one of the most
interesting relationships</i>

271
00:15:12,043 --> 00:15:16,048
<i>between artists
in a very long time.</i>

272
00:15:16,081 --> 00:15:19,518
<i>More interesting
than van Gogh and Gauguin,</i>

273
00:15:19,551 --> 00:15:22,687
<i>very, very special
and unique.</i>

274
00:15:25,155 --> 00:15:27,591
<i>When Peter
started his career</i>

275
00:15:27,625 --> 00:15:29,961
<i>as a photographer
in the '50s,</i>

276
00:15:29,995 --> 00:15:32,630
<i>it was not considered
a real art form.</i>

277
00:15:32,663 --> 00:15:35,299
<i>His photographs
were mostly portraits,</i>

278
00:15:35,332 --> 00:15:37,302
<i>mostly of people he knew,
but he did know</i>

279
00:15:37,335 --> 00:15:39,403
<i>some rather famous people,
you know.</i>

280
00:15:39,437 --> 00:15:43,108
<i>He's truly an artist,
but Peter was very difficult,</i>

281
00:15:43,140 --> 00:15:44,575
<i>and in terms
of having a career,</i>

282
00:15:44,609 --> 00:15:47,112
<i>he was not very good at it.</i>

283
00:15:47,144 --> 00:15:49,648
<i>These works were very small.</i>

284
00:15:49,681 --> 00:15:51,550
<i>The New York Art World
fit in one restaurant.</i>

285
00:15:51,582 --> 00:15:53,184
<i>One restaurant, okay?</i>

286
00:15:53,217 --> 00:15:55,252
<i>I heard of Peter
before I met him.</i>

287
00:15:55,285 --> 00:15:56,988
<i>The number of people
who would have heard of Peter,</i>

288
00:15:57,022 --> 00:15:58,991
<i>you know, 12?</i>

289
00:15:59,024 --> 00:16:01,493
<i>He may have been a saint
on Avenue A,</i>

290
00:16:01,525 --> 00:16:04,228
<i>but it was underground fame.</i>

291
00:16:04,261 --> 00:16:07,431
<i>He did not have
that standing in the quote,</i>

292
00:16:07,465 --> 00:16:11,302
<i>"real art world."
He was stranded.</i>

293
00:16:11,336 --> 00:16:14,339
<i>Nothing was going nowhere.</i>

294
00:16:14,371 --> 00:16:17,341
<i>Howdy-do,
howdy-do.</i>

295
00:16:17,375 --> 00:16:20,044
<i>This is Hujarino again.</i>

296
00:16:20,077 --> 00:16:23,481
<i>I was wondering if David
Steamed Vegetable was there?</i>

297
00:16:23,514 --> 00:16:27,052
<i>This is Peter Fast Juice.</i>

298
00:16:32,389 --> 00:16:34,158
<i>Peter last night
in the bar when I told him</i>

299
00:16:34,192 --> 00:16:36,028
<i>about doing a portfolio
and throwing out</i>

300
00:16:36,061 --> 00:16:37,461
<i>all the drawings
that I thought were</i>

301
00:16:37,495 --> 00:16:39,464
<i>aggressive or upsetting</i>

302
00:16:39,496 --> 00:16:42,033
<i>told me not to throw out
any drawings.</i>

303
00:16:42,067 --> 00:16:45,070
<i>No matter what my taste is
and what my ideas are,</i>

304
00:16:45,102 --> 00:16:47,038
<i>if I feel it's good,
there will be somebody</i>

305
00:16:47,072 --> 00:16:48,673
<i>who will pick up on it,</i>

306
00:16:48,706 --> 00:16:50,609
<i>I shouldn't start compromising</i>

307
00:16:50,642 --> 00:16:53,479
<i>and trying to adapt
to other people's taste.</i>

308
00:16:56,480 --> 00:16:59,283
<i>And last night, I was standing
around here 5:00,</i>

309
00:16:59,317 --> 00:17:02,453
<i>6:00 in the morning,
looking through the portfolio,</i>

310
00:17:02,486 --> 00:17:05,790
<i>looking at my photographs.</i>

311
00:17:05,824 --> 00:17:08,060
<i>I was really startled,
it was like the first time</i>

312
00:17:08,093 --> 00:17:09,661
<i>that I sat down
and really looked at them</i>

313
00:17:09,693 --> 00:17:12,297
<i>in ages since I did them.</i>

314
00:17:12,329 --> 00:17:16,233
<i>And I realized
that they are good.</i>

315
00:17:16,267 --> 00:17:18,470
<i>And there's absolutely
no reason for me</i>

316
00:17:18,502 --> 00:17:22,840
<i>to deny them or throw them
away, they're my life.</i>

317
00:17:22,874 --> 00:17:26,178
<i>And I don't owe it to anybody
to distort that</i>

318
00:17:26,211 --> 00:17:28,313
<i>just for their comfort.</i>

319
00:17:28,346 --> 00:17:33,317
<i>I think that everything
David thought an artist could</i>

320
00:17:33,351 --> 00:17:37,389
<i>and should be was embodied
by Peter.</i>

321
00:17:37,422 --> 00:17:40,826
<i>And Peter was the purest
of the lot.</i>

322
00:17:49,299 --> 00:17:53,137
<i>Peter had tremendous
respect for anyone else</i>

323
00:17:53,171 --> 00:17:57,509
<i>who had that same drive,
called them "those people."</i>

324
00:17:57,541 --> 00:18:01,679
<i>And "those people"
were special.</i>

325
00:18:01,712 --> 00:18:05,149
<i>He was a tough judge.</i>

326
00:18:05,182 --> 00:18:09,621
<i>And when he discovered David,
he realized he's one of them.</i>

327
00:18:09,653 --> 00:18:12,356
<i>This guy is one of them.</i>

328
00:18:12,390 --> 00:18:15,193
<i>He's talented in a chaotic way.</i>

329
00:18:15,226 --> 00:18:19,798
<i>And Peter saw right away
both the talent and the chaos.</i>

330
00:18:24,434 --> 00:18:26,637
<i>When Peter first met David

a rhythm machine</i>

<i>but it wasn't really the point.</i>

383
00:20:47,944 --> 00:20:50,347
<i>It was an effort to not
really necessarily make music,</i>

<i>but to have a film almost
for your ears.</i>

385
00:20:59,490 --> 00:21:01,859
<i>We ended up calling it
the Cacophonic Barrage.</i>

386
00:21:03,795 --> 00:21:05,462
<i>As opposed to music.</i>

387
00:21:05,496 --> 00:21:07,499
<i>We were really ahead
of our time</i>

388
00:21:07,531 --> 00:21:10,434
<i>with the use of samples, and
that was David's instrument.</i>

389
00:21:10,468 --> 00:21:13,371
<i>David would come up
to a mic with his handheld</i>

390

00:21:15,839 --> 00:21:17,509
<i>Yes, yes, yes, yes, yes.</i>

392
00:21:17,541 --> 00:21:20,711
<i>Yes. Because the guns
and the grenade,</i>

393
00:21:20,744 --> 00:21:23,048
<i>are great equalizers.
It used to be said</i>

394
00:21:23,080 --> 00:21:27,084
<i>that a revolver
made all men six feet tall.</i>

395
00:21:27,117 --> 00:21:28,886
<i>I heard a rumor
that Frank Zappa</i>

396
00:21:28,920 --> 00:21:31,389
<i>was in the audience one time
when we played,</i>

397
00:21:31,422 --> 00:21:35,326
<i>and he said that we used
the tapes like lead guitar,</i>

398
00:21:35,359 --> 00:21:36,994
<i>which I thought
was a great comment.</i>

399
00:21:37,028 --> 00:21:39,931
<i>There was a time in America,</i>

400
00:21:39,963 --> 00:21:44,568
<i>that if a, "glory hole"
appears,</i>

401
00:21:44,602 --> 00:21:45,937
<i>the police would throw them</i>

402
00:21:45,970 --> 00:21:50,775
<i>in jail on morals charges.</i>

403
00:21:50,807 --> 00:21:53,644
<i>Limp-wristed sissies.</i>

404
00:21:57,115 --> 00:21:59,683
<i>David wasn't really
of the art world.</i>

405
00:21:59,717 --> 00:22:02,086
<i>At that point in time,
he was just an individual</i>

406
00:22:02,119 --> 00:22:03,821
<i>that was doing his thing.</i>

407
00:22:03,855 --> 00:22:07,092
<i>He used to come over
to my house to make art</i>

408
00:22:07,125 --> 00:22:11,128
<i>because there was more room
in my house than in his house,</i>

409
00:22:11,162 --> 00:22:14,031
<i>which is funny, because I had
a tiny East Village apartment</i>

410
00:22:14,065 --> 00:22:17,369
<i>with a bathtub in the kitchen,
and a toilet in the hallway.</i>

411
00:22:17,402 --> 00:22:19,136
<i>We would get on the floor
and make stencils,</i>

412
00:22:19,170 --> 00:22:21,139
<i>and posters for the band.</i>

413
00:22:25,977 --> 00:22:28,446
<i>We made 12 posters,
put them up in the street,</i>

414
00:22:28,479 --> 00:22:32,650
<i>most of them are ripped down
immediately.</i>

415
00:22:32,682 --> 00:22:34,786
<i>So we started thinking
about more permanent things,</i>

416
00:22:34,818 --> 00:22:38,623
<i>so I started going out
in the street.</i>

417
00:22:38,655 --> 00:22:42,126
<i>I would put up images around
Astor Place along 8th Street.</i>

418
00:22:47,999 --> 00:22:49,500
<i>But I didn't
have any intention</i>

419
00:22:49,534 --> 00:22:51,636
<i>of being a street artist.</i>

420
00:22:51,669 --> 00:22:54,472
<i>I was just being provocative.</i>

421
00:22:54,505 --> 00:22:56,875
<i>Ready on the firing line.</i>

422
00:22:56,907 --> 00:22:58,642
<i>One night,
I went downtown,</i>

423
00:22:58,675 --> 00:23:01,545
<i>did every gallery door
I could find with images</i>

424
00:23:01,578 --> 00:23:07,519
<i>of the burning house,
the plane, and the figure.</i>

425
00:23:07,551 --> 00:23:11,522
<i>It was an aggressive thing.</i>

426
00:23:11,556 --> 00:23:15,460
<i>This idea of New York City
streets filled with soldiers,</i>

427
00:23:15,492 --> 00:23:17,595
<i>that kind of tense atmosphere.</i>

428
00:23:17,627 --> 00:23:19,997
<i>Halt, left flank, halt.</i>

429
00:23:27,805 --> 00:23:29,606
<i>I was just a rabid fan
of David.</i>

430
00:23:29,640 --> 00:23:32,009
<i>He was pretty obscure
at that time.</i>

431
00:23:32,042 --> 00:23:35,846
<i>But I knew about the piece him
and Julie Hair did</i>

432
00:23:35,880 --> 00:23:38,216
<i>on the Leo Castelli building,</i>

433
00:23:38,249 --> 00:23:40,852
<i>the shrine to contemporary art
at that time.</i>

434
00:23:40,884 --> 00:23:42,921
<i>Julie and I wanted to do
a series</i>

435
00:23:42,953 --> 00:23:45,589
<i>of action installations,
which were basically</i>

436
00:23:45,623 --> 00:23:47,692
<i>uninvited installations.</i>

437
00:23:47,724 --> 00:23:51,862
<i>We wanted to open up
what culture was to us</i>

438
00:23:51,895 --> 00:23:56,533
<i>as opposed to what was handled
by rich white people.</i>

439
00:23:56,567 --> 00:24:00,038
<i>I don't really remember
any planning stages of this,</i>

440
00:24:00,070 --> 00:24:03,640
<i>but we went to the west side</i>

441
00:24:03,673 --> 00:24:06,043
<i>where all the butchers were.</i>

442
00:24:06,076 --> 00:24:07,945
<i>The Meatpacking District,
which used to be</i>

443
00:24:07,979 --> 00:24:10,949
<i>a meat packing district,
you would never wanna go there</i>

444
00:24:10,981 --> 00:24:12,850
<i>because of the smell of blood</i>

445
00:24:12,884 --> 00:24:15,819
<i>from the actually butchering
and packing meat.</i>

446
00:24:15,853 --> 00:24:18,722
<i>There were big cans
outside of the butchers'</i>

447
00:24:18,756 --> 00:24:20,992
<i>with giant cow bones in them.</i>

448
00:24:21,025 --> 00:24:22,961
<i>So, we got a bunch of bones,</i>

449
00:24:22,993 --> 00:24:25,230
<i>we put them
in this little wagon.</i>

450
00:24:25,262 --> 00:24:27,164
<i>We brought
a couple hundred pounds</i>

451
00:24:27,198 --> 00:24:31,903
<i>of bloody cow bones,
dumped them into the staircase.</i>

452
00:24:31,935 --> 00:24:35,005
<i>Did a stencil painting with
spray paint of the empty plate,</i>

453
00:24:35,038 --> 00:24:35,973
<i>a knife, and a fork.</i>

454
00:24:36,007 --> 00:24:37,542
<i>Left, right, halt.</i>

455
00:24:37,575 --> 00:24:38,977
<i>And then military bombers,</i>

456
00:24:39,009 --> 00:24:40,545
<i>houses, and planes,</i>

457
00:24:40,577 --> 00:24:42,212
<i>and figures
recoiling on the wall,</i>

458
00:24:42,246 --> 00:24:43,948
<i>and then left.</i>

459
00:24:43,980 --> 00:24:45,650
<i>They stenciled
the despair of New York</i>

460
00:24:45,682 --> 00:24:47,251
<i>at that time,
and then they poured gallons</i>

461
00:24:47,285 --> 00:24:50,153
<i>and gallons of cow's blood
down the stairs.</i>

462
00:24:50,186 --> 00:24:53,690
<i>Nobody seemed to think
anything was amiss.</i>

463
00:24:53,723 --> 00:24:56,760
<i>They had thought it was just
part of the art world.</i>

464
00:24:59,564 --> 00:25:02,534
<i>Left, right, halt.</i>

465
00:25:07,038 --> 00:25:08,573
<i>Six months later,</i>

466
00:25:08,605 --> 00:25:11,108
<i>I was still doing stuff
on the street.</i>

467
00:25:11,142 --> 00:25:12,277
<i>That's when somebody
approached me</i>

468
00:25:12,309 --> 00:25:13,977
<i>from one of the galleries,</i>

469
00:25:14,010 --> 00:25:15,646
<i>asked me if I wanted to put
a painting</i>

470
00:25:15,680 --> 00:25:17,882
<i>in one of the shows,
so I said sure.</i>

471
00:25:22,920 --> 00:25:24,589
<i>David ends up
in a show with people</i>

472
00:25:24,622 --> 00:25:26,891
<i>like Julian Schnabel
and David Hockney,</i>

473
00:25:26,923 --> 00:25:28,292
<i>and lots of people
who were famous.</i>

474
00:25:28,326 --> 00:25:31,863
<i>He was completely unknown.</i>

475
00:25:34,030 --> 00:25:35,832
<i>A lot of artists
were doing graffiti</i>

476
00:25:35,865 --> 00:25:38,702
<i>in the East Village.
Keith Haring and Basquiat,</i>

477
00:25:38,736 --> 00:25:40,672
<i>and David was doing it.</i>

478
00:25:40,704 --> 00:25:42,874
<i>There were
no resources like now</i>

479
00:25:42,906 --> 00:25:44,608
<i>where you can go down
to the Lower East Side</i>

480
00:25:44,642 --> 00:25:46,644
<i>and there's like a dozen
young galleries</i>

481
00:25:46,676 --> 00:25:48,312
<i>you've never heard
of that are showing stuff.</i>

482
00:25:48,346 --> 00:25:50,213
<i>There was nothing.</i>

483
00:25:50,247 --> 00:25:53,351
<i>There was SoHo,
and there was Uptown,</i>

484
00:25:53,384 --> 00:25:56,320
<i>and there were
these established galleries.</i>

485
00:25:56,354 --> 00:25:59,023
<i>We didn't feel
we had any entree into there</i>

486
00:25:59,056 --> 00:26:02,226
<i>so we created space so we could
show our work and have fun.</i>

487
00:26:04,694 --> 00:26:07,197
<i>Dean Savard and I
started the gallery</i>

488
00:26:07,230 --> 00:26:11,269
<i>through a series
of one-night parties.</i>

489
00:26:11,301 --> 00:26:14,638
<i>There was no real intention
of making any money.</i>

490
00:26:14,672 --> 00:26:16,673
<i>We would put the art up
for one night,</i>

491
00:26:16,707 --> 00:26:19,243
<i>we'd invite friends,
we'd sat around on the floor</i>

492
00:26:19,276 --> 00:26:22,314
<i>drinking beer and smoking pot,
talking about art.</i>

493
00:26:24,682 --> 00:26:26,250
<i>When my gallery
first started,</i>

494
00:26:26,282 --> 00:26:29,753
<i>I had gotten I think
$200 back from my taxes.</i>

495
00:26:29,787 --> 00:26:32,056
<i>And I thought, oh,
let's have a party.</i>

496
00:26:32,088 --> 00:26:34,024
<i>I had photographs
in my bathroom</i>

497
00:26:34,057 --> 00:26:36,394
<i>and my bathroom was a toilet
and three walls</i>

498
00:26:36,426 --> 00:26:38,228
<i>because
the bathtub was in the kitchen.</i>

499
00:26:43,299 --> 00:26:46,937
<i>Never did I think that anybody
would show up after the party.</i>

500
00:26:46,971 --> 00:26:48,705
<i>Eventually,
we decided that, oh,</i>

501
00:26:48,739 --> 00:26:51,042
<i>we'll leave the art up
for a little longer.</i>

502
00:26:51,075 --> 00:26:55,813
<i>We were really drawn to David's
militaristic imagery.</i>

503
00:26:55,846 --> 00:26:58,650
<i>We decided that we would
put him into a group show.</i>

504
00:27:01,986 --> 00:27:05,823
<i>We put this really
large painting that David did.</i>

505
00:27:05,855 --> 00:27:09,894
<i>It was one of the most unusual
things I had seen an artist do,</i>

506
00:27:09,926 --> 00:27:13,063
<i>expressing what was going on
around us at the time,</i>

507
00:27:13,096 --> 00:27:15,400
<i>where mankind stood
at that point</i>

508
00:27:15,432 --> 00:27:18,702
<i>where self-annihilation
could occur.</i>

509
00:27:18,736 --> 00:27:21,072
<i>We were actually trying
to sell the work.</i>

510
00:27:21,105 --> 00:27:22,973
<i>I'm trying to remember
how much we were asking for it.</i>

511
00:27:23,007 --> 00:27:26,009
<i>I think probably around $5,000.</i>

512
00:27:26,042 --> 00:27:28,111
<i>Of course we didn't sell it
because nobody was coming</i>

513
00:27:28,144 --> 00:27:32,250
<i>into the gallery with that kind
of money back then.</i>

514
00:27:32,282 --> 00:27:33,950
<i>The interesting thing
about the East Village though,</i>

515
00:27:33,983 --> 00:27:35,720
<i>when there were artists
that were really</i>

516
00:27:35,752 --> 00:27:38,455
<i>kind of special,
everybody knew about it</i>

517
00:27:38,489 --> 00:27:40,290
<i>or there'd be this buzz
about it.</i>

518
00:27:40,324 --> 00:27:42,125
<i>So, there was a little bit
of buzz about David.</i>

519
00:27:42,159 --> 00:27:43,928
<i>He had that book,
Sounds in the Distance,</i>

520
00:27:43,961 --> 00:27:45,430
<i>which came out.</i>

521
00:27:45,462 --> 00:27:47,030
<i>And I was so impressed
because on the back</i>

522
00:27:47,064 --> 00:27:48,865
<i>it had a blurb
by William Burroughs.</i>

523
00:27:48,898 --> 00:27:51,368
<i>And I was like, oh, my God,
this artist</i>

524
00:27:51,402 --> 00:27:53,938
<i>must be really incredible
because William Burroughs</i>

525
00:27:53,971 --> 00:27:56,307
<i>wrote something about it.</i>

526
00:27:56,339 --> 00:28:00,110
<i>When we did the Famous Show,
which was in '82,</i>

527
00:28:00,144 --> 00:28:03,047
<i>we were looking for portraits
of famous people</i>

528
00:28:03,079 --> 00:28:05,348
<i>by famous
and soon to be famous artists.</i>

529
00:28:05,382 --> 00:28:08,186
<i>David brought in this painting,
Peter Hujar</i>

530
00:28:08,219 --> 00:28:11,221
<i>Dreaming about Yukio Mishima
in Saint Sebastian</i>

531
00:28:11,255 --> 00:28:12,957
<i>at the last minute
after everything</i>

532
00:28:12,990 --> 00:28:14,325
<i>was already up on the wall.</i>

533
00:28:14,357 --> 00:28:16,426
- <i>Typical.</i>
- <i>Typical.</i>

534
00:28:16,460 --> 00:28:17,961
<i>There was like no space</i>

535
00:28:17,994 --> 00:28:19,129
<i>because there were
so many people</i>

536
00:28:19,163 --> 00:28:20,998
<i>and he had a really big piece.</i>

537
00:28:21,030 --> 00:28:22,165
<i>So, where are you gonna put
a really big piece?</i>

538
00:28:22,199 --> 00:28:23,835
<i>You hang it from the ceiling.</i>

539
00:28:23,867 --> 00:28:25,769
<i>That's why
I love this photograph</i>

540
00:28:25,803 --> 00:28:28,172
<i>of the opening where you can't
really see any of the art</i>

541
00:28:28,204 --> 00:28:31,141
<i>but you can see David's piece
because it's on the ceiling.</i>

542
00:28:33,844 --> 00:28:35,813
<i>The early images
were all very simple imagines.</i>

543
00:28:35,846 --> 00:28:37,248
<i>But I just wanted
to record things</i>

544
00:28:37,280 --> 00:28:39,149
<i>that I didn't see
people recording</i>

545
00:28:39,182 --> 00:28:41,519
<i>and painting at that time.</i>

546
00:28:41,551 --> 00:28:44,421
<i>You know, I wanted to record
my own history</i>

547
00:28:44,454 --> 00:28:46,990
<i>or different history.</i>

548
00:28:47,023 --> 00:28:49,392
<i>And that's what painting
originally was for me.</i>

549
00:28:49,425 --> 00:28:52,329
<i>All the paintings are diaries
that I always thought</i>

550
00:28:52,363 --> 00:28:55,166
<i>as proof of my own existence.</i>

551
00:29:03,207 --> 00:29:05,409
<i>Welcome 3 Teens Kill 4.</i>

<i>that the President
had indeed been shot.</i>

555
00:29:14,317 --> 00:29:17,821
<i>The President was shot
once in the left chest.</i>

556
00:29:17,855 --> 00:29:20,391
<i>The bullet
entered from the left side.</i>

<i>Mrs. Reagan

559
00:29:23,961 --> 00:29:25,363

00:29:25,395 --> 00:29:27,831
<i>"Honey, I forgot to duck."</i>

561
00:29:27,865 --> 00:29:29,800
<i>It could be

<i>discovered them to be
in a big discussion</i>

585

<i>He wanted to do painting.</i>

593
00:30:38,635 --> 00:30:40,503
<i>He wanted to have more control

594
00:30:40,537 --> 00:30:42,606
<i>I remember having an argument
with David.</i>

595
00:30:42,640 --> 00:30:44,609
<i>He said to me,
"I can't really be friends</i>

<i>with someone who doesn't like

597
00:30:47,611 --> 00:30:49,380
<i>I said, "Well, David.</i>

598
00:30:49,413 --> 00:30:51,214
<i>There's a lot of your art
that I don't like</i>

599
00:30:51,248 --> 00:30:53,284
<i>and there's a lot of that anger
that I don't relate to</i>

600
00:30:53,317 --> 00:30:55,452
<i>and don't necessarily
wanna collaborate with."</i>

601
00:30:59,923 --> 00:31:01,325
<i>Hi.
This is Helen of Troy</i>

602
00:31:01,357 --> 00:31:03,627
<i>calling from Poughkeepsie.</i>

603
00:31:03,661 --> 00:31:06,464
<i>Oh, I got you on that one.
Ha-ha. Good-bye.</i>

604
00:31:15,204 --> 00:31:16,273
Hi. <i>This is Hujar.</i>

605
00:31:21,311 --> 00:31:23,313
- <i>Bye.</i>
- <i>David</i>

606
00:31:23,346 --> 00:31:27,684
<i>came over to our place
early one morning.</i>

607
00:31:27,718 --> 00:31:30,521
<i>He said, "You guys
got to come to this huge pier</i>

608
00:31:30,554 --> 00:31:34,158
<i>with all these walls
and there's nobody there."</i>

609
00:31:34,191 --> 00:31:37,560
<i>We had to slip
under a chain-link fence,</i>

610
00:31:37,594 --> 00:31:42,232
<i>got into the building,
and it was a really impressive,</i>

611
00:31:42,266 --> 00:31:46,070
<i>remarkable space,
for years had been abandoned</i>

612
00:31:46,103 --> 00:31:48,640
<i>like a couple football fields
in size.</i>

613
00:31:50,606 --> 00:31:53,109
<i>The idea was for artists</i>

614
00:31:53,143 --> 00:31:56,079
<i>to make work there
surreptitiously.</i>

615
00:31:56,113 --> 00:31:59,283
<i>It was very adventurous
and illegal.</i>

616
00:31:59,316 --> 00:32:00,951
<i>And that was very much
connected</i>

617
00:32:00,984 --> 00:32:03,453
<i>to David's knowledge
of the piers</i>

618
00:32:03,487 --> 00:32:07,258
<i>as a place for sexual tryst
and that whole subculture</i>

619
00:32:07,290 --> 00:32:10,260
<i>around it and in a way
they kind of spoiled that spot.</i>

620
00:32:10,294 --> 00:32:12,229
<i>And no one could go there
for their acts anymore</i>

621
00:32:12,261 --> 00:32:15,198
<i>because there were too many
people traipsing through.</i>

622
00:32:15,231 --> 00:32:19,202
<i>The ground floor
was thousands of square feet</i>

623
00:32:19,236 --> 00:32:21,405
<i>with very high ceilings.</i>

624
00:32:21,438 --> 00:32:23,607
<i>And upstairs there were rooms.</i>

625
00:32:23,640 --> 00:32:25,609
<i>David and I found</i>

626
00:32:25,642 --> 00:32:29,948
<i>piles of discarded files</i>

627
00:32:33,049 --> 00:32:36,319
<i>and psychological evaluations
from Bellevue.</i>

628
00:32:41,191 --> 00:32:43,461
<i>They had them draw
pictures of men and women</i>

629
00:32:43,493 --> 00:32:46,329
<i>and, yeah, most were
very, very loose, you know.</i>

630
00:32:46,363 --> 00:32:48,065
<i>It's like how you drew</i>

631
00:32:48,097 --> 00:32:50,032
<i>in elementary school
or something like that.</i>

632
00:32:50,034 --> 00:32:52,370
<i>And then others were sort of
more you would say like</i>

633
00:32:52,403 --> 00:32:54,471
<i>in quote "sophisticated,"
or this or that.</i>

634
00:32:54,505 --> 00:32:57,174
<i>But they were very emotional</i>

635
00:32:57,207 --> 00:33:00,478
<i>and had a great deal
of resonance in them.</i>

636
00:33:00,510 --> 00:33:02,178
<i>Hi. David, this is Kiki.</i>

637
00:33:02,211 --> 00:33:03,713
<i>I think you've got my squeegee</i>

638
00:33:03,747 --> 00:33:06,116
<i>for silkscreening
and I need it.</i>

639
00:33:06,150 --> 00:33:07,651
<i>Okay. Bye-bye.</i>

640
00:33:07,683 --> 00:33:09,686
<i>So, I was doing
a lot of silkscreening then</i>

641
00:33:09,720 --> 00:33:12,623
<i>and I taught him
how to make silkscreens.</i>

642
00:33:15,159 --> 00:33:17,395
<i>So we decided
to use these images</i>

643
00:33:17,428 --> 00:33:20,031
<i>and make a collaboration.</i>

644
00:33:26,804 --> 00:33:29,040
<i>The first time I met David,</i>

645
00:33:29,073 --> 00:33:32,343
<i>it wasn't physically.</i>

646
00:33:32,375 --> 00:33:36,748
<i>It was more mind to mind,
like vibration.</i>

647
00:33:38,714 --> 00:33:40,518
<i>It was summer '83.</i>

648
00:33:40,550 --> 00:33:43,287
<i>I wasn't involved
in the art scene.</i>

649
00:33:43,319 --> 00:33:45,755
<i>But one day,
there's a French photographer</i>

650
00:33:45,788 --> 00:33:50,094
<i>who came to visit New York
and he said,</i>

651
00:33:50,126 --> 00:33:52,062
<i>"Did you hear about
the abandoned pier</i>

652
00:33:52,096 --> 00:33:53,596
<i>where all these artists go</i>

653
00:33:53,630 --> 00:33:55,533
<i>and paint on the walls
and do things?"</i>

654
00:33:55,566 --> 00:33:57,067
<i>And I said, "No."</i>

655
00:34:00,471 --> 00:34:03,140
<i>He took me there.</i>

656
00:34:03,173 --> 00:34:05,576
<i>I fell in love with that place,
you know.</i>

657
00:34:05,608 --> 00:34:10,713
<i>It was like
so deathly romantic.</i>

658
00:34:10,746 --> 00:34:14,417
<i>One day, somebody told me
the story of this artist,</i>

659
00:34:14,451 --> 00:34:17,554
<i>David Wojnarowicz,
who opened the place.</i>

660
00:34:17,588 --> 00:34:21,492
<i>And I remember right away
I had a crush on this guy.</i>

661
00:34:21,525 --> 00:34:24,762
<i>I thought this guy
must really be great, you know,</i>

662
00:34:24,795 --> 00:34:26,563
<i>to open a place like that,</i>

663
00:34:26,597 --> 00:34:31,168
<i>to call people to come
and collaborate and paint.</i>

664
00:34:31,201 --> 00:34:34,271
<i>For me, he was already
somebody special.</i>

665
00:34:36,139 --> 00:34:38,174
<i>In the end, you know,
hundreds of artists</i>

666
00:34:38,208 --> 00:34:40,811
<i>were doing things there
and French fashion magazines</i>

667
00:34:40,844 --> 00:34:43,114
<i>were doing shoots in there.</i>

668
00:34:43,146 --> 00:34:45,650
<i>It got so big that police came.</i>

669
00:34:47,885 --> 00:34:51,122
<i>They closed it down.</i>

670
00:34:51,155 --> 00:34:54,525
<i>The whole magic was lost.</i>

671
00:34:54,557 --> 00:34:58,128
<i>They started tearing it down</i>

672
00:34:58,161 --> 00:35:00,763
<i>and I have a picture
of the Gagging Cow of David's</i>

673
00:35:00,797 --> 00:35:03,201
<i>while the pier
is being pulled down.</i>

674
00:35:05,434 --> 00:35:10,574
<i>And then the pier disappeared
into the river and was gone.</i>

675
00:35:12,509 --> 00:35:16,347
<i>I think the East Village scene
exploded at the same time.</i>

676
00:35:16,380 --> 00:35:18,215
<i>It wasn't until David had</i>

677
00:35:18,248 --> 00:35:20,550
<i>his first solo exhibition
for us</i>

678
00:35:20,583 --> 00:35:23,153
<i>that everything broke loose.</i>

679
00:35:23,186 --> 00:35:25,221
<i>The first exhibition
was very interesting</i>

680
00:35:25,255 --> 00:35:26,690
<i>in a sense
that it was something</i>

681
00:35:26,722 --> 00:35:28,558
<i>nobody had really seen before,</i>

682
00:35:28,592 --> 00:35:30,461
<i>painting things
that weren't really intended</i>

683
00:35:30,494 --> 00:35:32,296
<i>to be painted on.</i>

684
00:35:32,329 --> 00:35:35,332
<i>He'd stencil images
over supermarket posters,</i>

685
00:35:35,364 --> 00:35:38,334
<i>trashcan lids, driftwood.</i>

686
00:35:38,367 --> 00:35:40,503
<i>Everything was about
something that was found</i>

687
00:35:40,536 --> 00:35:42,672
<i>and didn't cost anything
because, again,</i>

688
00:35:42,706 --> 00:35:44,341
<i>nobody had any money.</i>

689
00:35:44,373 --> 00:35:47,177
<i>It was that exhibition
that Grace Glueck,</i>

690
00:35:47,210 --> 00:35:50,446
<i>the New York Times art critic
rode up on her bicycle,</i>

691
00:35:50,480 --> 00:35:51,615
<i>started looking
at the artwork,</i>

692
00:35:51,648 --> 00:35:53,550
<i>asking us about the artist</i>

693
00:35:53,583 --> 00:35:57,221
<i>and asked for a photograph
of one of David's pieces.</i>

694
00:35:57,253 --> 00:36:00,723
<i>Grace Glueck showed up,
and it was really a joke to us</i>

695
00:36:00,757 --> 00:36:02,425
<i>that she wanted
to write something.</i>

696
00:36:02,458 --> 00:36:04,594
<i>And so for us,
it was very tongue-in-cheek,</i>

697
00:36:04,628 --> 00:36:06,797
<i>you know, did the very
serious interviews.</i>

698
00:36:06,829 --> 00:36:08,364
<i>And she went around
to other galleries</i>

699
00:36:08,398 --> 00:36:10,367
<i>like Gracie's
and suddenly boom.</i>

700
00:36:10,400 --> 00:36:13,637
<i>An article appeared
in the Sunday Lifestyle section</i>

701
00:36:13,670 --> 00:36:15,539
<i>of the New York Times.</i>

702
00:36:15,572 --> 00:36:17,240
<i>It talked about the galleries
in the East Village,</i>

703
00:36:17,273 --> 00:36:18,641
<i>David's artwork.</i>

704
00:36:18,675 --> 00:36:20,244
<i>It was after
that the collectors</i>

705
00:36:20,277 --> 00:36:23,780
<i>really started coming down.</i>

706
00:36:23,813 --> 00:36:28,251
<i>This limousine pulls up
in front of our little gritty</i>

707
00:36:28,284 --> 00:36:30,587
<i>drug-infested street.</i>

708
00:36:30,621 --> 00:36:33,257
<i>Robert Pincus-Witten, who was
an art critic in New York,</i>

709
00:36:33,289 --> 00:36:34,992
<i>and a very elegant woman,</i>

710
00:36:35,025 --> 00:36:36,594
<i>comes into the gallery.</i>

711
00:36:36,626 --> 00:36:38,795
<i>They looked at
each piece, examining.</i>

712
00:36:38,829 --> 00:36:41,231
<i>Robert's whispering
in her ear.</i>

713
00:36:41,264 --> 00:36:44,335
<i>Soon after he said,
"We'll take this one,</i>

714
00:36:44,367 --> 00:36:45,802
<i>this one, this one,
and this one.</i>

715
00:36:45,835 --> 00:36:47,437
<i>We'll take that one
over there."</i>

716
00:36:47,471 --> 00:36:48,871
<i>And it was like, oh, my God.</i>

717
00:36:48,905 --> 00:36:50,874
<i>I practically
ran over to The Pyramid</i>

718
00:36:50,907 --> 00:36:53,443
<i>and David and Dean
were having a beer.</i>

719
00:36:53,476 --> 00:36:55,712
<i>I said, "Oh, my God.
We sold so much work."</i>

720
00:36:55,746 --> 00:36:58,414
<i>It was such a euphoric feeling.</i>

721
00:36:58,447 --> 00:37:00,317
<i>All of a sudden,
the art worlds gave</i>

722
00:37:00,349 --> 00:37:03,487
<i>this East Village scene
its 15 minutes fame.</i>

723
00:37:03,519 --> 00:37:04,655
<i>Our neighborhood
now all of a sudden</i>

724
00:37:04,688 --> 00:37:06,490
<i>had 60 galleries in it</i>

725
00:37:06,523 --> 00:37:09,327
<i>and that people were coming
by in limousines.</i>

726
00:37:10,626 --> 00:37:11,996
<i>"Fuck You Faggot Fucker."</i>

727
00:37:12,028 --> 00:37:13,963
<i>We were going
around the gallery</i>

728
00:37:13,996 --> 00:37:17,835
<i>putting the names on these
little stickers on the wall.</i>

729
00:37:17,867 --> 00:37:19,570
<i>"And what's the name
of this one?"</i>

730
00:37:19,603 --> 00:37:21,606
<i>And David said,
"Fuck You Faggot Fucker."</i>

731
00:37:23,639 --> 00:37:26,777
<i>It's a piece of torn paper
that David found on the street</i>

732
00:37:26,809 --> 00:37:30,280
<i>that somebody had written
this homophobic slur on.</i>

733
00:37:30,313 --> 00:37:33,283
<i>And I said,
"David, that's so offensive.</i>

734
00:37:33,317 --> 00:37:35,019
<i>Do we have to call it that?"</i>

735
00:37:35,052 --> 00:37:37,855
<i>David was like, "That's
the name, it's gonna stick."</i>

736
00:37:37,887 --> 00:37:39,656
<i>"Fuck Faggot Fucker."</i>

737
00:37:39,690 --> 00:37:41,659
<i>I walked in and the painting
just riveted me.</i>

738
00:37:41,692 --> 00:37:44,927
<i>It's two boys kissing
over a map.</i>

739
00:37:44,960 --> 00:37:46,829
<i>And then on the four corners,</i>

740
00:37:46,862 --> 00:37:50,400
<i>there is Brian Butterick
posing as Saint Sebastian</i>

741
00:37:50,434 --> 00:37:54,471
<i>and there was David
posing in the Christodora.</i>

742
00:37:54,503 --> 00:37:56,706
<i>I said,
"I'll give you $3,000."</i>

743
00:37:56,739 --> 00:37:58,442
<i>And he said, "Sure."</i>

744
00:37:58,474 --> 00:38:00,810
<i>Back then 1984,
that was a lot of money.</i>

745
00:38:00,844 --> 00:38:04,548
<i>But it's been a prized
possession since then.</i>

746
00:38:04,581 --> 00:38:05,749
<i>Hi, David. It's Marissa.</i>

747
00:38:05,782 --> 00:38:07,418
<i>Prison Rape is back.</i>

748
00:38:07,451 --> 00:38:09,519
<i>It just walked in the door
from Montreal.</i>

749
00:38:09,552 --> 00:38:11,688
<i>So could you come and pick
it up as soon as possible?</i>

750
00:38:11,722 --> 00:38:13,824
<i>Thank you. Bye-bye.</i>

751
00:38:13,856 --> 00:38:16,527
<i>I think a lot of the reason
David is important now</i>

752
00:38:16,559 --> 00:38:19,362
<i>is because people recognized</i>

753
00:38:19,396 --> 00:38:21,731
<i>emergent queer sensibility
in David.</i>

754
00:38:21,764 --> 00:38:23,900
<i>"I'm not gay
as in I love you.</i>

755
00:38:23,934 --> 00:38:27,705
<i>I'm queer as in fuck off."</i>

756
00:38:27,737 --> 00:38:31,841
<i>Everything I did
with David was collaboration.</i>

757
00:38:31,875 --> 00:38:35,713
<i>But the concept of it
has always been David.</i>

758
00:38:35,746 --> 00:38:40,818
<i>He proposed to make a poster
about being queer in America.</i>

759
00:38:40,851 --> 00:38:43,887
<i>David knew a place
under the Brooklyn Bridge.</i>

760
00:38:43,920 --> 00:38:45,755
<i>We went there with a truck.</i>

761
00:38:45,789 --> 00:38:48,625
<i>I put some blood
on David's face.</i>

762
00:38:48,657 --> 00:38:51,594
<i>We lit the scene
with the lights of the truck</i>

763
00:38:51,628 --> 00:38:53,064
<i>and we took the photo.</i>

764
00:38:56,867 --> 00:38:58,602
<i>When I went to the darkroom</i>

765
00:38:58,635 --> 00:39:02,773
<i>and I started printing
the photo, it scared me.</i>

766
00:39:02,806 --> 00:39:05,909
<i>It really scared me
to see this image of David</i>

767
00:39:05,942 --> 00:39:08,445
<i>beat up
coming under the chemicals.</i>

768
00:39:08,478 --> 00:39:09,780
<i>It looked so real.</i>

769
00:39:09,813 --> 00:39:11,148
<i>A number of months ago,</i>

770
00:39:11,181 --> 00:39:12,548
<i>I read in the newspaper
that there was</i>

771
00:39:12,581 --> 00:39:14,117
<i>a Supreme Court ruling</i>

772
00:39:14,150 --> 00:39:15,985
<i>which states
that homosexuals in America</i>

773
00:39:16,018 --> 00:39:17,920
<i>have no constitutional rights</i>

774
00:39:17,954 --> 00:39:20,023
<i>against the government's
invasion of their privacy.</i>

775
00:39:20,056 --> 00:39:23,025
<i>The paper stated only people
who are heterosexual,</i>

776
00:39:23,059 --> 00:39:25,596
<i>or married, or have families</i>

777
00:39:25,628 --> 00:39:27,630
<i>can expect
these constitutional rights.</i>

778
00:39:27,664 --> 00:39:30,701
<i>And realizing I got nothing
left to lose in my actions,</i>

779
00:39:30,733 --> 00:39:34,471
<i>I let my hands become weapons,
my teeth become weapons,</i>

780
00:39:34,503 --> 00:39:35,972
<i>every bone,
and muscle, and fiber,</i>

781
00:39:36,005 --> 00:39:37,875
<i>and ounce of blood
become weapons,</i>

782
00:39:37,907 --> 00:39:41,811
<i>and I feel prepared
for the rest of my life.</i>

783
00:39:41,844 --> 00:39:43,513
<i>Hi, David, it's Gracie.</i>

784
00:39:43,547 --> 00:39:46,048
<i>Can you give me a call at home?</i>

785
00:39:46,081 --> 00:39:47,550
<i>About the Whitney.</i>

786
00:39:56,092 --> 00:39:59,430
<i>'85 was a big year.</i>

787
00:39:59,463 --> 00:40:02,900
<i>David had two major pieces
in the Whitney Biennial.</i>

788
00:40:02,932 --> 00:40:04,768
<i>I mean, that's amazing.</i>

789
00:40:04,800 --> 00:40:07,438
<i>Everything happened
really fast.</i>

790
00:40:07,471 --> 00:40:09,072
<i>Hi, I want to make sure
somebody told you</i>

791
00:40:09,105 --> 00:40:10,673
<i>you made the front page
of the Washington Post</i>

792
00:40:10,706 --> 00:40:12,708
<i>on Sunday for the Biennial.</i>

793
00:40:12,742 --> 00:40:15,612
<i>A big reproduction
of your piece, bye-bye.</i>

794
00:40:15,644 --> 00:40:19,650
<i>It was major for all of us
to be accepted</i>

795
00:40:19,682 --> 00:40:22,018
<i>in the bigger art world</i>

796
00:40:22,052 --> 00:40:23,954
<i>but David wasn't, like,</i>

797
00:40:23,987 --> 00:40:26,456
<i>"Oh, my God, I got
into the Whitney Biennial."</i>

798
00:40:26,489 --> 00:40:27,990
- <i>Not at all.</i>
- <i>No.</i>

799
00:40:28,023 --> 00:40:29,826
<i>No, I mean,
he really thought about</i>

800
00:40:29,860 --> 00:40:31,929
<i>whether he wanted to do it.</i>

801
00:40:31,961 --> 00:40:33,764
<i>David has a certain kind</i>

802
00:40:33,797 --> 00:40:35,465
<i>of political consciousness</i>

803
00:40:35,498 --> 00:40:37,800
<i>that plays into his work,
who owns it,</i>

804
00:40:37,833 --> 00:40:40,036
<i>where it's shown,
the whole thing.</i>

805
00:40:40,070 --> 00:40:42,105
<i>He was not
particularly thrilled</i>

806
00:40:42,137 --> 00:40:46,108
<i>about a bunch of rich money
capitalist people</i>

807
00:40:46,141 --> 00:40:48,177
<i>in the Whitney
thinking that he was great.</i>

808
00:40:48,210 --> 00:40:50,513
<i>There's no gratification
for that in him</i>

809
00:40:50,547 --> 00:40:53,784
<i>and those people are very
classist and judgmental.</i>

810
00:40:53,817 --> 00:40:56,619
<i>He wanted
to be recognized by people</i>

811
00:40:56,652 --> 00:40:58,120
<i>that would appreciate his work,</i>

812
00:40:58,153 --> 00:41:00,990
<i>but the right people
for the right reasons.</i>

813
00:41:01,023 --> 00:41:03,993
<i>You know, Peter Hujar
had a lot of the same attitude.</i>

814
00:41:09,599 --> 00:41:10,968
<i>Yeah,
it's only been recently</i>

815
00:41:11,001 --> 00:41:13,003
<i>that there's art stars,
there's people</i>

816
00:41:13,036 --> 00:41:15,972
<i>who make tremendous
amounts of money overnight.</i>

817
00:41:22,112 --> 00:41:23,713
<i>I agree.</i>

818
00:41:31,086 --> 00:41:32,956
<i>That's it, I mean,</i>

819
00:41:32,989 --> 00:41:34,590

into little mini factories.</i>

- <i>There's...</i>
- <i>Yeah, I got...</i>

<i>...nothing human about it.</i>

822
00:41:37,193 --> 00:41:39,897
<i>There's no odor,
there's no stink.</i>

<i>Hey, David, did you know
you're in New York Magazine?</i>

824
00:41:41,898 --> 00:41:43,033
<i>They did a review

825
00:41:43,065 --> 00:41:44,967

were two collectors.</i>

829
00:41:53,943 --> 00:41:57,213
<i>He was on Wall Street
and she had a cashmere store</i>

830
00:41:57,246 --> 00:41:58,882
<i>and her name was Adrian.</i>

831
00:41:58,914 --> 00:42:01,050
<i>Now it's like Adriana
or something.</i>

832
00:42:01,083 --> 00:42:03,185
<i>But anyway,
at that time she was Adrian.</i>

833
00:42:03,219 --> 00:42:05,556
<i>They commissioned David
and it was the most money</i>

834
00:42:05,588 --> 00:42:07,891
<i>that David had ever gotten
for anything to do</i>

835
00:42:07,923 --> 00:42:10,960
<i>this big installation
in their basement.</i>

836
00:42:10,994 --> 00:42:13,196
<i>He needed the money
so he was glad</i>

837
00:42:13,228 --> 00:42:16,732
<i>that I had made this sale
but a part of him</i>

838
00:42:16,766 --> 00:42:20,737
<i>really was very unhappy
about it.</i>

839
00:42:20,769 --> 00:42:23,172
<i>David didn't really like
rich people.</i>

840
00:42:25,108 --> 00:42:28,679
<i>So he took all this garbage
off of the street</i>

841
00:42:28,711 --> 00:42:31,114
<i>and put it
into the installation.</i>

842
00:42:34,150 --> 00:42:36,219
<i>They were scouring
all the vacant lots</i>

843
00:42:36,251 --> 00:42:39,155
<i>to grab the nastiest shit
they could.</i>

844
00:42:39,188 --> 00:42:41,257
<i>You know, it looked like
the plague had descended</i>

845
00:42:41,291 --> 00:42:43,660
<i>upon their place,
basically filled it with trash</i>

846
00:42:43,693 --> 00:42:45,329
<i>and made a beautiful
installation out of it</i>

847
00:42:45,362 --> 00:42:48,699
<i>but so much of it
just looked like tetanus.</i>

848
00:42:48,731 --> 00:42:52,068
<i>And it had bugs.</i>

849
00:42:52,101 --> 00:42:54,704
<i>Adrian was like freaked out</i>

850
00:42:54,737 --> 00:42:56,606
<i>these bugs were being brought</i>

851
00:42:56,639 --> 00:42:59,775
<i>into her pristine brownstone.</i>

852
00:42:59,809 --> 00:43:01,979
<i>Of course David loved it,
he brought in more.</i>

853
00:43:04,114 --> 00:43:05,849
<i>David, hi, it's Gracie.</i>

854
00:43:05,882 --> 00:43:07,884
<i>I'm just checking in,
seeing how everything's</i>

855
00:43:07,916 --> 00:43:09,318
<i>going with the installation,</i>

856
00:43:09,351 --> 00:43:14,023
<i>if you need any help,
and what's up?</i>

857
00:43:14,056 --> 00:43:16,092
<i>Basically just
a what's up call.</i>

858
00:43:16,126 --> 00:43:17,961
<i>Um, okay.</i>

859
00:43:17,994 --> 00:43:20,064
<i>I wanted to talk to you,
okay, bye-bye.</i>

860
00:43:21,998 --> 00:43:24,900
<i>So when you look at
the photographs Peter Hujar</i>

861
00:43:24,934 --> 00:43:27,903
<i>took of that installation,
it was all garbage,</i>

862
00:43:27,936 --> 00:43:30,773
<i>it was great like
a lot of figures.</i>

863
00:43:30,806 --> 00:43:32,408
<i>There was the burning child</i>

864
00:43:32,442 --> 00:43:34,811
<i>and there was the big mural
in the background,</i>

865
00:43:34,844 --> 00:43:37,047
<i>there was a tree
and a lot of cow skulls.</i>

866
00:43:37,079 --> 00:43:39,682
<i>It was an incredible
installation.</i>

867
00:43:39,715 --> 00:43:43,353
<i>Well, in retrospect,
that was Mnuchin.</i>

868
00:43:43,385 --> 00:43:46,889
<i>The A-hole dealer
whose son Steve Mnuchin</i>

869
00:43:46,922 --> 00:43:49,125
<i>is part of Trump's cabinet.</i>

870
00:43:50,960 --> 00:43:53,329
<i>I got really angry
of that sudden attention,</i>

871
00:43:53,362 --> 00:43:55,031
- <i>money being thrown at me.</i>
- <i>Yeah.</i>

872
00:43:55,065 --> 00:43:57,000
<i>I was starving
for years earlier,</i>

873
00:43:57,032 --> 00:43:59,735
<i>and then it suddenly crossed
a line where what I make</i>

874
00:43:59,768 --> 00:44:02,304
<i>is feeding me, is...
it's giving me all this stuff</i>

875
00:44:02,338 --> 00:44:05,042
<i>but then I have all this hate
about the structure of that</i>

876
00:44:05,074 --> 00:44:06,842
- <i>because it's so full of shit.</i>
- <i>Yeah.</i>

877
00:44:06,876 --> 00:44:08,845
<i>And this is something
that rattled me.</i>

878
00:44:08,878 --> 00:44:10,981
<i>I realized that
I came out of a totally violent</i>

879
00:44:11,014 --> 00:44:13,216
<i>fucked-up background
growing up as a kid,</i>

880
00:44:13,248 --> 00:44:15,317
<i>came to New York,
went onto the streets,</i>

881
00:44:15,351 --> 00:44:17,186
<i>almost died on the streets,</i>

882
00:44:17,219 --> 00:44:19,288
<i>but once your economics
are taken care of,</i>

883
00:44:19,322 --> 00:44:21,124
<i>once you no longer
have to struggle</i>

884
00:44:21,157 --> 00:44:24,094
<i>to pay rent or eat,
any shit that's underneath</i>

885
00:44:24,126 --> 00:44:25,895
<i>goes to the surface.</i>

886
00:44:29,398 --> 00:44:32,234
<i>Hi Dave, it's Pat.</i>

887
00:44:32,268 --> 00:44:36,173
<i>I don't know if you're home
or maybe you're sleeping,</i>

888
00:44:36,206 --> 00:44:38,742
<i>well, the first thing
I wanna say</i>

889
00:44:38,775 --> 00:44:42,345
<i>is that your paintings
are fantastic.</i>

890
00:44:42,378 --> 00:44:46,216
<i>I'm so impressed,
I'm so proud of you,</i>

891
00:44:46,248 --> 00:44:48,451
<i>I tried to take pictures
but they wouldn't</i>

892
00:44:48,485 --> 00:44:50,187
<i>let me use the flash and I...</i>

893
00:44:50,219 --> 00:44:52,021
<i>Patty
was always close to David.</i>

894
00:44:52,054 --> 00:44:54,257
<i>I love you a lot, bye.</i>

895
00:44:54,289 --> 00:44:58,461
<i>Even after we grew up,
we were completely split up.</i>

896
00:44:58,494 --> 00:45:01,063
<i>So the first time I ever
learned about his artwork,</i>

897
00:45:01,097 --> 00:45:03,233
<i>I picked up some magazines</i>

898
00:45:03,266 --> 00:45:05,135
<i>and there was David
in Life Magazine.</i>

899
00:45:05,168 --> 00:45:07,738
<i>I was so much in awe with...
I was like,</i>

900
00:45:07,771 --> 00:45:10,340
<i>"Wow, look where this guy
is at," you know.</i>

901
00:45:18,447 --> 00:45:20,382
<i>I finally found a way
to get in touch with him,</i>

902
00:45:20,416 --> 00:45:22,885
<i>it was an interesting thing
to sit down with him,</i>

903
00:45:22,918 --> 00:45:25,321
<i>I came to New York
and he started spewing off</i>

904
00:45:25,355 --> 00:45:29,259
<i>about he was
a child prostitute, he's gay.</i>

905
00:45:29,291 --> 00:45:33,864
<i>And I get the feeling
that he was testing me.</i>

906
00:45:33,896 --> 00:45:35,965
<i>I think he was afraid</i>

907
00:45:35,998 --> 00:45:39,935
<i>that I would never accept him
being gay.</i>

908
00:45:39,969 --> 00:45:43,139
<i>I just was glad
that he was okay.</i>

909
00:45:43,172 --> 00:45:44,974
<i>David, this is Steve calling,</i>

910
00:45:45,007 --> 00:45:47,143
<i>I don't know if you need maps
for your artwork</i>

911
00:45:47,177 --> 00:45:50,347
<i>but I just threw out
about 5,000 of them today.</i>

912
00:45:50,380 --> 00:45:53,450
<i>I worked for AAA
so he had free maps</i>

913
00:45:53,483 --> 00:45:55,952
<i>whenever he needed them,
I'd make sure he got them.</i>

914
00:45:55,985 --> 00:45:57,887
<i>Maybe I can save you
some money.</i>

915
00:45:57,920 --> 00:46:01,290
<i>Okay. Bye-bye.</i>

916
00:46:01,324 --> 00:46:03,193
<i>Hey David,
this is Richard, you know,</i>

917
00:46:03,226 --> 00:46:04,561
<i>I just wanted to get together
with you and talk about</i>

918
00:46:04,594 --> 00:46:05,961
<i>making a movie
or something like that.</i>

919
00:46:05,994 --> 00:46:08,097
<i>I'm up, give me a buzz, bye.</i>

920
00:46:10,166 --> 00:46:11,902
<i>It was one of those nights</i>

921
00:46:11,934 --> 00:46:14,003
<i>David and I
wanted to get high.</i>

922
00:46:14,036 --> 00:46:16,972
<i>I said, "Hey, why don't we
try shooting ecstasy?</i>

923
00:46:17,005 --> 00:46:18,307
<i>I've got some of that."</i>

924
00:46:22,478 --> 00:46:27,317
<i>David and I got into this deep,
deep conversation, I said,</i>

925
00:46:27,349 --> 00:46:29,451
<i>"Let's make a movie
where we try to figure out</i>

926
00:46:29,485 --> 00:46:32,122
<i>why young people
are the way they are,</i>

927
00:46:32,155 --> 00:46:35,559
<i>the punks and all that stuff,"
and just shot a quick movie.</i>

928
00:46:35,592 --> 00:46:37,494
<i>I think we did it in a day.</i>

929
00:46:37,527 --> 00:46:40,831
<i>David played the father,
Karen Finley played the mother,</i>

930
00:46:40,864 --> 00:46:43,032
<i>it ended up being
a lot of things</i>

931
00:46:43,065 --> 00:46:45,935
<i>from David's childhood
and he definitely had</i>

932
00:46:45,969 --> 00:46:48,003
<i>the most fucked-up stories.</i>

933
00:46:48,036 --> 00:46:50,472
- Don't get away...
- Stop playing with your food.

934
00:46:50,505 --> 00:46:52,308
Do you call this food?

935
00:46:52,342 --> 00:46:54,443
Look, it isn't even fucking
cooked, it's all bloody.

936
00:46:54,476 --> 00:46:56,145
Shut up.

937
00:46:56,179 --> 00:46:58,048
<i>David said that
when he was a kid,</i>

938
00:46:58,081 --> 00:46:59,316
<i>they had a rabbit.</i>

939
00:46:59,349 --> 00:47:00,984
<i>My father got us rabbits</i>

940
00:47:01,016 --> 00:47:03,419
<i>and he said
he gave away the rabbits</i>

941
00:47:03,452 --> 00:47:06,322
<i>and then Patty
found out somehow</i>

942
00:47:06,356 --> 00:47:08,258
<i>that he had them butchered
and we winded up</i>

943
00:47:08,291 --> 00:47:11,228
<i>eating our pet rabbit
which I think was horrific.</i>

944
00:47:11,260 --> 00:47:13,396
<i>And it really
bothered David too.</i>

945
00:47:13,429 --> 00:47:16,333
- You know what this is?
- No.

946
00:47:18,333 --> 00:47:19,869
See that?

947
00:47:19,902 --> 00:47:21,370
That's my bunny,
what are doing to it?

948
00:47:21,403 --> 00:47:24,273
And you know what this is?

949
00:47:24,306 --> 00:47:27,543
No, no, no.

950
00:47:27,577 --> 00:47:30,146
<i>David finally
was starting to deal</i>

951
00:47:30,179 --> 00:47:33,349
<i>with what had happened to him
during his childhood.</i>

952
00:47:33,382 --> 00:47:36,118
<i>He started using heroin.</i>

953
00:47:36,152 --> 00:47:41,224
<i>It was almost a social drug
in the East Village.</i>

954
00:47:41,257 --> 00:47:44,059
<i>I got some junk
that I had lying around,</i>

955
00:47:44,092 --> 00:47:47,263
<i>so I did it in the bathroom.</i>

956
00:47:47,297 --> 00:47:50,400
<i>The light and everything just
started making me feel sick.</i>

957
00:47:52,068 --> 00:47:53,536
<i>David took drugs in a way</i>

958
00:47:53,568 --> 00:47:56,373
<i>that Peter was sure
would destroy him.</i>

959
00:47:56,405 --> 00:47:59,643
<i>And Peter knew too much
about the way artists</i>

960
00:47:59,675 --> 00:48:02,112
<i>can sabotage themselves
to let that</i>

961
00:48:02,144 --> 00:48:03,980
<i>go one step further.</i>

962
00:48:04,012 --> 00:48:05,481
<i>At some point, Peter said,</i>

963
00:48:05,514 --> 00:48:08,951
<i>"David, what are those marks
on your arm?"</i>

964
00:48:08,985 --> 00:48:10,553
<i>He said, "Oh, it's nothing."</i>

965
00:48:10,585 --> 00:48:12,488
<i>He said,
"Don't tell me it's nothing</i>

966
00:48:12,521 --> 00:48:17,126
<i>and you're going to stop
taking heroin today, right now.</i>

967
00:48:17,159 --> 00:48:20,297
<i>You will never take it again
as long as you live</i>

968
00:48:20,329 --> 00:48:24,134
<i>and if you do, I will
never speak to you again,</i>

969
00:48:24,166 --> 00:48:26,068
<i>you will be dead to me."</i>

970
00:48:26,101 --> 00:48:29,471
<i>David started crying
and he'd stopped heroin.</i>

971
00:48:29,505 --> 00:48:32,175
<i>He never took it again
because Peter was the most</i>

972
00:48:32,208 --> 00:48:35,945
<i>important relationship
in his life.</i>

973
00:48:35,978 --> 00:48:37,413
<i>They first had an affair</i>

974
00:48:37,447 --> 00:48:40,617
<i>but I don't think
that lasted that long.</i>

975
00:48:40,650 --> 00:48:43,286
<i>And then they were friends
but at a certain point,</i>

976
00:48:43,318 --> 00:48:46,355
<i>I really thought of David
as Peter's son.</i>

977
00:48:46,389 --> 00:48:48,024
<i>Peter didn't think of him
as Peter's son</i>

978
00:48:48,056 --> 00:48:49,224
<i>and probably David didn't
but to me,</i>

979
00:48:49,257 --> 00:48:50,426
<i>that's what it seemed like.</i>

980
00:49:18,286 --> 00:49:20,990
<i>I met David
at the Bijou Theater</i>

981
00:49:22,592 --> 00:49:25,262
<i>which was a gay porn theater.</i>

982
00:49:26,728 --> 00:49:30,466
<i>Our eyes met and we went
to the bathroom</i>

983
00:49:30,500 --> 00:49:33,068
<i>and had a little bit of sex
and I said,</i>

984
00:49:33,101 --> 00:49:35,471
<i>"Why don't you come over
to my apartment?"</i>

985
00:49:35,505 --> 00:49:38,641
<i>Which I rarely did with people
that I met there,</i>

986
00:49:38,673 --> 00:49:42,077
<i>but I was just fascinated
with this guy.</i>

987
00:49:42,110 --> 00:49:44,513
<i>We left and I asked David
what he did and he said</i>

988
00:49:44,547 --> 00:49:46,081
<i>he was a painter and I said,</i>

989
00:49:46,114 --> 00:49:48,050
<i>"What, of houses?"
And he said,</i>

990
00:49:48,083 --> 00:49:49,418
<i>"No, no, no, no,
I paint things."</i>

991
00:49:49,452 --> 00:49:51,321
<i>And apparently
he was quite well-known</i>

992
00:49:51,353 --> 00:49:53,255
<i>in the East Village
and I didn't know who he was,</i>

993
00:49:53,289 --> 00:49:55,057
<i>I had no idea.</i>

994
00:49:55,090 --> 00:49:59,228
<i>So he came over and we had
a really sweet night.</i>

995
00:49:59,262 --> 00:50:00,730
<i>He left me a little painting</i>

996
00:50:00,762 --> 00:50:03,032
<i>that he did for me
that I really loved.</i>

997
00:50:03,065 --> 00:50:05,634
<i>And we started
seeing each other.</i>

998
00:50:08,371 --> 00:50:11,240
<i>I felt my world was very
different after I met David.</i>

999
00:50:11,273 --> 00:50:14,443
<i>I was totally swept up
with him.</i>

1000
00:50:14,476 --> 00:50:17,212
<i>So here I am, heading out
into the cold winds</i>

1001
00:50:17,246 --> 00:50:19,282
<i>of the canyon streets,
walking down and across</i>

1002
00:50:19,315 --> 00:50:20,717
<i>Avenue C towards my home,</i>

1003
00:50:20,750 --> 00:50:22,485
<i>with the smell
and the taste of him</i>

1004
00:50:22,518 --> 00:50:26,088
<i>wrapped around my neck and jaw
like some scarf.</i>

1005
00:50:26,121 --> 00:50:28,123
<i>And how it follows me
in and out of restaurants</i>

1006
00:50:28,157 --> 00:50:30,626
<i>and past cops,
and early morning children,</i>

1007
00:50:30,659 --> 00:50:33,128
<i>and past bakery windows
filled with brides and grooms</i>

1008
00:50:33,161 --> 00:50:37,099
<i>on rows, and rows, and rows
of endless wedding cakes.</i>

1009
00:50:37,132 --> 00:50:38,534
<i>Hey, juicy lips,
are you there?</i>

1010
00:50:38,568 --> 00:50:40,403
<i>It's about 12:00...</i>

1011
00:50:40,436 --> 00:50:43,173
<i>David kept talking
about this best friend of his</i>

1012
00:50:43,206 --> 00:50:45,809
<i>that he had in the East Village
and we had to go see him,</i>

1013
00:50:45,842 --> 00:50:47,577
<i>and his name was Peter
and then Peter,</i>

1014
00:50:47,610 --> 00:50:49,813
<i>and all of a sudden I said,</i>

1015
00:50:49,846 --> 00:50:51,514
<i>"Are you talking about
Peter Hujar?"</i>

1016
00:50:51,547 --> 00:50:53,550
<i>And he said,
"Well, how did you know that?"</i>

1017
00:50:53,583 --> 00:50:55,285
<i>Howdy-do, howdy-do?</i>

1018
00:50:55,318 --> 00:50:57,653
<i>I said, "Well,
I had a little affair</i>

1019
00:50:57,686 --> 00:51:00,289
<i>in the '70s with Peter
for a month,"</i>

1020
00:51:00,322 --> 00:51:01,824
<i>and I kept thinking,
"Oh, great,</i>

1021
00:51:01,858 --> 00:51:04,160
<i>Peter's gonna tell him
I'm an asshole."</i>

1022
00:51:04,193 --> 00:51:07,797
<i>But Peter thought actually
that I was good for David,</i>

1023
00:51:07,829 --> 00:51:09,632
<i>you know,
that I could help David,</i>

1024
00:51:09,664 --> 00:51:13,603
<i>I could be a settling
kind of thing for him</i>

1025
00:51:13,635 --> 00:51:15,637
<i>which actually
probably is true.</i>

1026
00:51:15,670 --> 00:51:18,674
<i>But they were so close
that it was...</i>

1027
00:51:18,708 --> 00:51:20,410
<i>I couldn't even describe
what that was,</i>

1028
00:51:20,443 --> 00:51:22,278
<i>much different
than our relationship</i>

1029
00:51:22,311 --> 00:51:23,780
<i>and I was just
trying to figure out</i>

1030
00:51:23,813 --> 00:51:25,414
<i>where I fit in his life.</i>

1031
00:51:25,447 --> 00:51:27,317
<i>He said,
"I have three priorities,</i>

1032
00:51:27,349 --> 00:51:30,686
<i>in this order, Peter,
my art, and you."</i>

1033
00:51:30,719 --> 00:51:33,155
<i>And I had to find
that to be okay,</i>

1034
00:51:33,188 --> 00:51:35,757
<i>it was hard at first
but as I looked at it,</i>

1035
00:51:35,791 --> 00:51:37,327
<i>I realized
there was no threat there.</i>

1036
00:51:37,360 --> 00:51:39,162
<i>This was a whole other thing.</i>

1037
00:51:44,567 --> 00:51:46,168
<i>Hi David,
this is Carlo</i>

1038
00:51:46,202 --> 00:51:48,138
<i>wishing you a Happy New Year.</i>

1039
00:51:48,170 --> 00:51:49,605
<i>Hi David,
this is Bridgette,</i>

1040
00:51:49,639 --> 00:51:52,242
<i>I wanted to wish you
Happy New Year.</i>

1041
00:51:52,275 --> 00:51:54,443
<i>Howdy-do, howdy-do?</i>

1042
00:51:54,476 --> 00:51:56,145
<i>It's the nufter.</i>

1043
00:51:56,179 --> 00:51:57,680
<i>And the monks last night
were great,</i>

1044
00:51:57,713 --> 00:51:58,848
<i>you would've actually
loved them.</i>

1045
00:51:58,880 --> 00:52:00,549
<i>I think there were 10 of them</i>

1046
00:52:00,583 --> 00:52:03,820
<i>and they sang in voices
that was like, "Whoa."</i>

1047
00:52:03,853 --> 00:52:05,188
<i>You know, deeper than that.</i>

1048
00:52:05,221 --> 00:52:07,724
<i>"Oh, uh." No, I can't do it.</i>

1049
00:52:07,757 --> 00:52:12,195
<i>"Oh, hmm, uh."</i>

1050
00:52:12,228 --> 00:52:13,329
<i>It was really nice,</i>

1051
00:52:13,362 --> 00:52:16,166
<i>they did a healing ceremony.</i>

1052
00:52:16,199 --> 00:52:18,768
<i>Well, anyway, that's all
I have to say, goodbye.</i>

1053
00:52:25,608 --> 00:52:27,644
<i>I took Peter to the doctor.</i>

1054
00:52:27,677 --> 00:52:30,280
<i>I don't remember
what was wrong with Peter</i>

1055
00:52:30,313 --> 00:52:33,849
<i>or how Peter felt
that made him have that test.</i>

1056
00:52:33,882 --> 00:52:35,684
<i>They didn't tell you there.</i>

1057
00:52:35,717 --> 00:52:37,819
<i>It took two weeks
for this test to come back.</i>

1058
00:52:37,853 --> 00:52:42,659
<i>And I remember very much
that Peter called me,</i>

1059
00:52:42,692 --> 00:52:44,661
<i>and I can't describe to you.</i>

1060
00:52:44,693 --> 00:52:47,529
<i>I said, "What... how are you?"
And he goes, "Fran,"</i>

1061
00:52:47,563 --> 00:52:50,833
<i>and then he made the sound
like, um, like a...</i>

1062
00:52:50,865 --> 00:52:52,902
<i>not a scream
but kind of a scream.</i>

1063
00:52:52,934 --> 00:52:55,204
<i>It more sounded to me
like an animal sound,</i>

1064
00:52:55,237 --> 00:52:56,739
<i>not like a human.</i>

1065
00:52:56,771 --> 00:53:00,309
<i>He said his test
came back positive.</i>

1066
00:53:00,342 --> 00:53:02,411
<i>When Peter
was diagnosed with AIDS,</i>

1067
00:53:02,445 --> 00:53:03,813
<i>I came over 10 minutes later.</i>

1068
00:53:03,846 --> 00:53:05,548
<i>He went to meet me at the door</i>

1069
00:53:05,581 --> 00:53:07,483
<i>and there was some
mail that had arrived</i>

1070
00:53:07,516 --> 00:53:08,918
<i>and it fell on the floor and I
remember him picking it up</i>

1071
00:53:08,951 --> 00:53:10,686
<i>and turning
and just saying,</i>

1072
00:53:10,719 --> 00:53:12,955
<i>"Even something like
getting a piece of mail</i>

1073
00:53:12,989 --> 00:53:15,391
<i>has an entirely
different meaning."</i>

1074
00:53:15,423 --> 00:53:18,228
<i>And from that,
I constructed something</i>

1075
00:53:18,260 --> 00:53:20,362
<i>of what this man is facing.</i>

1076
00:53:25,434 --> 00:53:26,702
<i>And I felt very sad.</i>

1077
00:53:26,735 --> 00:53:28,538
<i>I felt angry. I felt fear.</i>

1078
00:53:28,570 --> 00:53:32,442
<i>I felt the possibility
of my own diagnosis.</i>

1079
00:53:32,474 --> 00:53:34,277
<i>David was sitting
at the table</i>

1080
00:53:34,309 --> 00:53:35,612
<i>and he was crying
and I didn't know</i>

1081
00:53:35,644 --> 00:53:37,347
<i>what was going on
and he told me</i>

1082
00:53:37,380 --> 00:53:39,582
<i>that Peter
had been diagnosed with AIDS.</i>

1083
00:53:39,614 --> 00:53:41,250
<i>He was destroyed.</i>

1084
00:53:41,284 --> 00:53:42,619
<i>I mean,
it was so emotional for him.</i>

1085
00:53:42,652 --> 00:53:45,655
<i>It was so upsetting.</i>

1086
00:53:45,688 --> 00:53:47,456
<i>When Peter was diagnosed,</i>

1087
00:53:47,489 --> 00:53:50,259
<i>David asked me
if I could help him</i>

1088
00:53:50,293 --> 00:53:52,295
<i>because Peter
really had no income.</i>

1089
00:53:52,327 --> 00:53:54,463
<i>He had no money.
He had no... he had nothing</i>

1090
00:53:54,496 --> 00:53:57,266
<i>and he didn't wanna lose
his apartment.</i>

1091
00:53:57,300 --> 00:54:00,937
<i>I worked as Director of
New York City's AIDS Program.</i>

1092
00:54:00,969 --> 00:54:04,373
<i>And it was through Tom
that I met David.</i>

1093
00:54:04,407 --> 00:54:08,311
<i>This was an epidemic
of great proportions.</i>

1094
00:54:10,579 --> 00:54:13,449
<i>And the city ignored it
for quite a while.</i>

1095
00:54:13,481 --> 00:54:15,518
<i>In fact, everyone ignored it.</i>

1096
00:54:25,960 --> 00:54:28,630
<i>People with AIDS
who were getting sick</i>

1097
00:54:28,664 --> 00:54:31,467
<i>and losing their jobs,
were coming to apply</i>

1098
00:54:31,500 --> 00:54:34,436
<i>for public assistance.</i>

1099
00:54:34,469 --> 00:54:36,972
<i>Because AIDS had
a stigma already,</i>

1100
00:54:37,005 --> 00:54:39,641
<i>none of the traditional systems
in place</i>

1101
00:54:39,675 --> 00:54:41,377
<i>wanted anything
to do with them.</i>

1102
00:54:41,409 --> 00:54:43,645
<i>The staff wouldn't touch
their paperwork.</i>

1103
00:54:43,679 --> 00:54:46,750
<i>They often died before
they got any benefits at all.</i>

1104
00:54:48,884 --> 00:54:52,322
<i>Mayor Koch finally decided that
something needed to be done.</i>

1105
00:54:52,355 --> 00:54:55,692
<i>He started a very little
program and I have to say,</i>

1106
00:54:55,724 --> 00:54:58,795
<i>we probably broke every rule
in the book</i>

1107
00:54:58,827 --> 00:55:00,929
<i>in order to get people
what they needed.</i>

1108
00:55:02,931 --> 00:55:05,567
<i>So I went over
like a good caseworker,</i>

1109
00:55:05,601 --> 00:55:07,603
<i>and I fell in love with him.</i>

1110
00:55:07,635 --> 00:55:10,972
<i>I mean,
he was an amazing person.</i>

1111
00:55:11,005 --> 00:55:14,009
<i>I could certainly ease
a lot of his fears,</i>

1112
00:55:14,043 --> 00:55:16,679
<i>he couldn't believe that
he wouldn't lose his apartment</i>

1113
00:55:16,711 --> 00:55:20,349
<i>and he'd have
some kind of income.</i>

1114
00:55:20,382 --> 00:55:22,617
<i>Hippity-hoppity
happy Easter eggs.</i>

1115
00:55:22,650 --> 00:55:25,721
<i>This is Peter Cottontail.</i>

1116
00:55:25,755 --> 00:55:27,957
<i>This is the
ex-Peter Cottontail.</i>

1117
00:55:31,393 --> 00:55:32,694
<i>Are you there?</i>

1118
00:55:32,728 --> 00:55:34,731
<i>Hello? Howdy-do?</i>

1119
00:55:34,764 --> 00:55:36,666
<i>Peter was prone
to great depression,</i>

1120
00:55:36,699 --> 00:55:39,668
<i>I mean, he never took a photo
after his diagnosis.</i>

1121
00:55:39,702 --> 00:55:41,971
<i>He gave it up entirely.</i>

1122
00:55:51,646 --> 00:55:53,382
<i>A couple of times,
I did confront him</i>

1123
00:55:53,416 --> 00:55:55,051
<i>because I thought he was stuck.</i>

1124
00:55:55,083 --> 00:55:56,885
<i>And that was the only time
I allowed myself</i>

1125
00:55:56,918 --> 00:55:58,554
<i>to confront him
when I thought that he was just</i>

1126
00:55:58,586 --> 00:56:01,757
<i>shutting down
and so full of rage</i>

1127
00:56:01,791 --> 00:56:04,626
<i>and not strong enough
to express it.</i>

1128
00:56:14,769 --> 00:56:16,639
<i>And I remember him
threatening to throw himself</i>

1129
00:56:16,672 --> 00:56:18,507
<i>in front of a car
because he was mad.</i>

1130
00:56:18,541 --> 00:56:20,109
<i>But he didn't have the strength
to walk to the curb</i>

1131
00:56:20,141 --> 00:56:23,745
<i>and throw himself
in front of the car.</i>

1132
00:56:23,778 --> 00:56:26,148
<i>He talked about killing himself
endlessly, brutally.</i>

1133
00:56:26,181 --> 00:56:27,817
<i>"I wanna go to that building
across the street</i>

1134
00:56:27,849 --> 00:56:29,485
<i>and jump off the roof"
and he would say,</i>

1135
00:56:29,518 --> 00:56:31,487
<i>"I'm gonna do it.
I'm gonna do it."</i>

1136
00:56:31,519 --> 00:56:33,722
<i>And he would say it every day
until one day we gave him</i>

1137
00:56:33,755 --> 00:56:35,690
<i>a number of a doctor
who would give medicine</i>

1138
00:56:35,724 --> 00:56:36,826
<i>to kill himself.</i>

1139
00:56:36,858 --> 00:56:38,193
<i>And once I gave him the number,</i>

1140
00:56:38,226 --> 00:56:39,594
<i>he tucked it away
and never spoke</i>

1141
00:56:39,628 --> 00:56:41,431
<i>about killing himself again.</i>

1142
00:56:58,213 --> 00:57:00,615
<i>David had like a huge career,</i>

1143
00:57:00,648 --> 00:57:02,617
<i>then when I did
The Four Elements,</i>

1144
00:57:02,650 --> 00:57:05,454
<i>we didn't sell a thing.
It was over.</i>

1145
00:57:05,487 --> 00:57:07,722
<i>The art world
if very fickle like that.</i>

1146
00:57:07,755 --> 00:57:10,725
<i>Once you start getting
a certain amount of something,</i>

1147
00:57:10,759 --> 00:57:15,197
<i>you have to keep it going,
or it fizzles out.</i>

1148
00:57:15,231 --> 00:57:19,035
<i>I had this naive sense
that once people supported work</i>

1149
00:57:19,068 --> 00:57:22,505
<i>then, that doesn't
just disappear that, you know,</i>

1150
00:57:22,538 --> 00:57:24,106
<i>that they'll watch what you do</i>

1151
00:57:24,139 --> 00:57:26,709
<i>and they'll take interest
and they'll follow it,</i>

1152
00:57:26,742 --> 00:57:29,545
<i>which isn't the case at all.</i>

1153
00:57:29,577 --> 00:57:32,648
<i>It was the end
of the East Village scene</i>

1154
00:57:32,681 --> 00:57:35,050
<i>and the so-called
East Village art</i>

1155
00:57:35,083 --> 00:57:37,553
<i>had just gone out of style.</i>

1156
00:57:42,690 --> 00:57:44,526
<i>Hi, this is Hujar.</i>

1157
00:57:44,559 --> 00:57:46,661
<i>I'm on my way
to the horse pistol</i>

1158
00:57:46,695 --> 00:57:48,698
<i>to stay there for a while.</i>

1159
00:57:48,731 --> 00:57:52,902
<i>I guess you can find my number
by calling Cabrini Hospital.</i>

1160
00:57:52,934 --> 00:57:55,137
<i>Goodbye.</i>

1161
00:57:55,170 --> 00:57:56,972
<i>He lost weight.</i>

1162
00:57:57,005 --> 00:58:00,009
<i>He had the beginnings
of dementia.</i>

1163
00:58:00,041 --> 00:58:02,944
<i>He just was kind of
fading away.</i>

1164
00:58:02,978 --> 00:58:04,680
<i>I'm sitting
in his hospital room</i>

1165
00:58:04,713 --> 00:58:07,517
<i>so high up in the upper
reaches of the building</i>

1166
00:58:07,550 --> 00:58:09,919
<i>and leaning against the glass
to the window of his room</i>

1167
00:58:09,952 --> 00:58:12,688
<i>where I can see dizzily down
into the street.</i>

1168
00:58:12,721 --> 00:58:15,858
<i>It's a gradual turn of
the Earth outside the windows.</i>

1169
00:58:15,891 --> 00:58:18,695
<i>I wonder what it is to fall
such distances.</i>

1170
00:58:20,728 --> 00:58:23,865
<i>I'm afraid he's really dying.</i>

1171
00:58:23,898 --> 00:58:28,069
<i>And he barely opens his eyes
for more than a few seconds.</i>

1172
00:58:28,103 --> 00:58:29,771
<i>And his breath was coming</i>

1173
00:58:29,804 --> 00:58:34,009
<i>in rapid fire bursts
like machine gun.</i>

1174
00:58:34,043 --> 00:58:36,546
<i>I turn from the silence
in the window and look at him</i>

1175
00:58:36,579 --> 00:58:40,016
<i>and an iris appears
beneath one half-lifted eyelid</i>

1176
00:58:40,048 --> 00:58:43,052
<i>and its strength bores
right through me.</i>

1177
00:58:43,085 --> 00:58:44,820
<i>And I turn away
almost embarrassed,</i>

1178
00:58:44,853 --> 00:58:48,824
<i>having as much life in me
as he has.</i>

1179
00:58:48,856 --> 00:58:51,760
- <i>Stand up and fight.</i>
- <i>Okay.</i>

1180
00:58:54,262 --> 00:58:57,065
<i>It was Thanksgiving
and I met David</i>

1181
00:58:57,099 --> 00:59:00,135
<i>in Peter's room
at the hospital.</i>

1182
00:59:00,168 --> 00:59:04,272
<i>Ethyl Eichelberger was there
and Peter was in a coma.</i>

1183
00:59:04,306 --> 00:59:06,041
<i>I mean, he really
wasn't responsive</i>

1184
00:59:06,074 --> 00:59:07,710
<i>in any kind of way.</i>

1185
00:59:10,679 --> 00:59:14,884
<i>We're all sitting there
and Ethyl says very quietly,</i>

1186
00:59:14,916 --> 00:59:17,052
<i>"He's not breathing anymore.</i>

1187
00:59:17,085 --> 00:59:19,087
<i>His chest
isn't going up and down."</i>

1188
00:59:22,925 --> 00:59:24,794
<i>We called the nurse in.</i>

1189
00:59:24,827 --> 00:59:27,297
<i>And the nurse said,
"Yes, he had passed."</i>

1190
00:59:33,735 --> 00:59:35,170
<i>And then David says,</i>

1191
00:59:35,204 --> 00:59:37,073
<i>"Could you all
leave me alone with him?"</i>

1192
00:59:43,144 --> 00:59:45,081
<i>If I could attach
our blood vessels</i>

1193
00:59:45,114 --> 00:59:48,284
<i>so that we would become
each other, I would.</i>

1194
00:59:48,317 --> 00:59:50,920
<i>If I could attach
our blood vessels</i>

1195
00:59:50,952 --> 00:59:53,088
<i>in order to anchor you
to the Earth,</i>

1196
00:59:53,121 --> 00:59:56,692
<i>to this present time, to me,
I would.</i>

1197
00:59:58,293 --> 01:00:01,896
<i>It makes me weep
to feel the history of you,</i>

1198
01:00:01,929 --> 01:00:04,634
<i>of your flesh beneath my hands,</i>

1199
01:00:04,666 --> 01:00:06,869
<i>in a time of so much loss.</i>

1200
01:00:08,903 --> 01:00:12,108
<i>It makes me weep,
all these moments</i>

1201
01:00:12,141 --> 01:00:15,845
<i>will be lost in time
like tears in rain.</i>

1202
01:00:19,213 --> 01:00:21,317
<i>Smell the flowers
while you can.</i>

1203
01:00:23,284 --> 01:00:27,355
<i>When Peter died,
I went out to dinner with Anita</i>

1204
01:00:27,389 --> 01:00:30,893
<i>and this nurse,
he was talking about,</i>

1205
01:00:30,925 --> 01:00:32,894
<i>sometimes you could tell
somebody was infected</i>

1206
01:00:32,927 --> 01:00:34,864
<i>because they'd get
a string of pearls</i>

1207
01:00:34,896 --> 01:00:39,300
<i>along your neck which was
glands that would swell up.</i>

1208
01:00:39,333 --> 01:00:41,736
<i>So while I'm sitting there,</i>

1209
01:00:41,769 --> 01:00:43,838
<i>I run the fingers down
my neck and sure enough</i>

1210
01:00:43,871 --> 01:00:46,308
<i>I have a string of pearls,
swollen glands.</i>

1211
01:00:48,177 --> 01:00:51,047
<i>I decided to get tested.</i>

1212
01:00:51,079 --> 01:00:53,315
<i>It came back positive.</i>

1213
01:00:53,347 --> 01:00:56,085
<i>I had pretty good T cell
at that point.</i>

1214
01:00:56,117 --> 01:00:58,253
<i>I wasn't sick or anything.</i>

1215
01:00:58,286 --> 01:01:01,056
<i>David, he was very sympathetic
and very supportive</i>

1216
01:01:01,090 --> 01:01:02,792
<i>but then at some point,
I said,</i>

1217
01:01:02,824 --> 01:01:04,125
<i>"You know,
you're being very supportive,</i>

1218
01:01:04,159 --> 01:01:07,963
<i>but you don't know
your status."</i>

1219
01:01:07,996 --> 01:01:09,231
<i>The first time I saw David,</i>

1220
01:01:09,264 --> 01:01:12,168
<i>David had markers of infection,</i>

1221
01:01:12,201 --> 01:01:14,170
<i>oral candidiasis, thrush.</i>

1222
01:01:14,202 --> 01:01:16,338
<i>He didn't have a competent
immune system.</i>

1223
01:01:16,371 --> 01:01:19,208
<i>I don't think this came
as a shock to David.</i>

1224
01:01:23,478 --> 01:01:26,715
<i>Hi, I just woke up.</i>

1225
01:01:26,748 --> 01:01:30,251
<i>Waking up every hour</i>

1226
01:01:30,284 --> 01:01:32,187
<i>for the last,</i>

1227
01:01:32,221 --> 01:01:34,222
<i>I don't know,
three or four hours.</i>

1228
01:01:39,260 --> 01:01:41,831
<i>So I was diagnosed with ARC</i>

1229
01:01:41,864 --> 01:01:44,833
<i>sometime in the summer.</i>

1230
01:01:44,867 --> 01:01:48,237
<i>Now near the end of November,</i>

1231
01:01:48,269 --> 01:01:50,940
<i>I'm living at Peter's house,
Peter Hujar,</i>

1232
01:01:50,972 --> 01:01:54,177
<i>because I couldn't afford
the other apartment that I had.</i>

1233
01:02:03,318 --> 01:02:05,121
<i>David came back positive</i>

1234
01:02:05,153 --> 01:02:08,389
<i>but his T cells
were really ravaged.</i>

1235
01:02:08,422 --> 01:02:10,058
<i>David asked Dr. Friedman,</i>

1236
01:02:10,092 --> 01:02:12,294
<i>"Do I have so few
that I can name them?"</i>

1237
01:02:12,327 --> 01:02:13,996
<i>Back then,
the magic number</i>

1238
01:02:14,028 --> 01:02:16,297
<i>was 200 T cells.</i>

1239
01:02:16,331 --> 01:02:20,269
<i>If you could keep the patient
at 200 T cells or higher,</i>

1240
01:02:20,302 --> 01:02:23,405
<i>there'd be less
opportunistic infections.</i>

1241
01:02:23,438 --> 01:02:26,075
<i>He had less than a hundred
when he was tested</i>

1242
01:02:26,108 --> 01:02:28,144
<i>so he was already in bad shape.</i>

1243
01:02:28,177 --> 01:02:29,812
<i>Peter, hi.</i>

1244
01:02:29,844 --> 01:02:31,846
<i>It's... oh, Peter, oh, my God.</i>

1245
01:02:31,880 --> 01:02:34,550
<i>I'm looking at the name,
what a...</i>

1246
01:02:34,583 --> 01:02:38,253
<i>unbelievable
psychological slur.</i>

1247
01:02:38,286 --> 01:02:40,789
<i>This is Gracie calling
for David.</i>

1248
01:02:40,822 --> 01:02:42,357
<i>He came in to the gallery
and told us.</i>

1249
01:02:42,391 --> 01:02:44,293
<i>He was very quiet about it.</i>

1250
01:02:44,326 --> 01:02:47,829
<i>I mean, he came in and he said
that he'd just been tested</i>

1251
01:02:47,862 --> 01:02:50,031
<i>and he found out
that he had it.</i>

1252
01:02:50,065 --> 01:02:52,101
<i>It was devastating for me.</i>

1253
01:02:52,134 --> 01:02:55,471
<i>I mean, I felt very protective
of David.</i>

1254
01:02:55,503 --> 01:02:58,840
<i>When Keith Haring came out
about having AIDS,</i>

1255
01:02:58,873 --> 01:03:01,509
<i>it just seemed like
everybody had to run,</i>

1256
01:03:01,543 --> 01:03:04,313
<i>buy something of his because
he was gonna die of AIDS.</i>

1257
01:03:04,346 --> 01:03:06,181
<i>He had AIDS
and he was gonna die.</i>

1258
01:03:06,215 --> 01:03:09,451
<i>It was so gross
how Keith was treated</i>

1259
01:03:09,483 --> 01:03:12,387
<i>and how everything around him,
what that was all about,</i>

1260
01:03:12,420 --> 01:03:14,556
<i>and I didn't want that
for David.</i>

1261
01:03:14,590 --> 01:03:17,026
<i>I mean,
I knew how private David was</i>

1262
01:03:17,059 --> 01:03:21,530
<i>and so when he told me,
my first reaction was</i>

1263
01:03:21,563 --> 01:03:23,865
<i>that we shouldn't tell anyone.</i>

1264
01:03:23,898 --> 01:03:25,467
<i>Which of course
is the wrong response</i>

1265
01:03:25,500 --> 01:03:27,036
<i>to have with David.</i>

1266
01:03:27,068 --> 01:03:29,137
<i>That's when I picked up
the phone</i>

1267
01:03:29,170 --> 01:03:30,839
<i>and called Barry Blinderman
and said,</i>

1268
01:03:30,873 --> 01:03:33,943
<i>"You have to do this
retrospective now,</i>

1269
01:03:33,976 --> 01:03:36,378
<i>like, now."</i>

1270
01:03:39,414 --> 01:03:41,884
<i>She was right
and that this is what I do,</i>

1271
01:03:41,916 --> 01:03:43,952
<i>books and retrospectives
and...</i>

1272
01:03:43,985 --> 01:03:46,554
<i>I was an avid fan
of his work.</i>

1273
01:03:46,588 --> 01:03:49,490
<i>I bought the painting,
Fuck You Faggot Fucker,</i>

1274
01:03:49,523 --> 01:03:51,460
<i>back in 1984.</i>

1275
01:03:51,492 --> 01:03:54,063
<i>There was an urgency
to do the show</i>

1276
01:03:54,096 --> 01:03:56,264
<i>while he was alive.</i>

1277
01:03:56,297 --> 01:03:59,434
<i>I wrote a grant to the NEA,</i>

1278
01:03:59,467 --> 01:04:02,605
<i>got the grant worth $15,000</i>

1279
01:04:02,637 --> 01:04:07,009
<i>and started working with David
planning the exhibition,</i>

1280
01:04:07,041 --> 01:04:08,376
<i>then the catalogue.</i>

1281
01:04:13,614 --> 01:04:15,583
<i>I thought the phrase
"Tongues of Flame"</i>

1282
01:04:15,617 --> 01:04:17,920
<i>was very appropriate.
It's a biblical reference.</i>

1283
01:04:17,952 --> 01:04:19,554
<i>It's a reference to a play.
It's a reference</i>

1284
01:04:19,588 --> 01:04:21,023
<i>to a silent movie.</i>

1285
01:04:21,056 --> 01:04:23,157
<i>But mostly, Tongues of Flame,</i>

1286
01:04:23,190 --> 01:04:27,096
<i>I'm thinking what a...
an amazing orator he was.</i>

1287
01:04:27,128 --> 01:04:28,963
<i>I was thinking
about the Burning Child,</i>

1288
01:04:28,996 --> 01:04:30,932
<i>I was thinking
about the Burning House,</i>

1289
01:04:30,965 --> 01:04:34,168
<i>the incendiary aspect of it,
the passion.</i>

1290
01:04:34,202 --> 01:04:37,206
<i>And it just seemed like
everything that was connected</i>

1291
01:04:37,239 --> 01:04:40,009
<i>with David was on fire.</i>

1292
01:04:43,612 --> 01:04:45,146
<i>One of the things
that happened</i>

1293
01:04:45,179 --> 01:04:47,415
<i>after my diagnosis
is this thing</i>

1294
01:04:47,449 --> 01:04:49,652
<i>of this may be the last work
I do. So it's, like,</i>

1295
01:04:49,684 --> 01:04:53,221
<i>trying to focus everything
and channel it into the square,</i>

1296
01:04:53,255 --> 01:04:55,124
<i>or into this photograph,
or into this thing</i>

1297
01:04:55,157 --> 01:04:58,126
<i>that it's all got to go in,
all the anger,</i>

1298
01:04:58,159 --> 01:05:01,029
<i>all the emotions,
all the thoughts.</i>

1299
01:05:01,063 --> 01:05:04,566
<i>I'm working on a series
of sex images</i>

1300
01:05:04,599 --> 01:05:09,004
<i>that take environments
like the sky,</i>

1301
01:05:09,036 --> 01:05:12,106
<i>the ocean, an airplane,</i>

1302
01:05:12,139 --> 01:05:15,344
<i>train movements, a forest,</i>

1303
01:05:15,376 --> 01:05:17,313
<i>and I'll superimpose</i>

1304
01:05:17,346 --> 01:05:22,117
<i>a circle that has
a very explicit sex act.</i>

1305
01:05:22,150 --> 01:05:25,554
<i>And most of them
are homosexual acts.</i>

1306
01:05:31,092 --> 01:05:33,228
<i>Outside of the sex series,</i>

1307
01:05:33,260 --> 01:05:37,699
<i>I placed these circular images
inside the field of painting</i>

1308
01:05:37,733 --> 01:05:40,402
<i>and so for me the circles
are like cells</i>

1309
01:05:40,434 --> 01:05:43,038
<i>and they contain information.</i>

1310
01:05:43,070 --> 01:05:46,741
<i>And I see them
as microscopic views</i>

1311
01:05:46,775 --> 01:05:50,512
<i>so it's like looking
into the interior of something,</i>

1312
01:05:50,545 --> 01:05:55,017
<i>like looking at a spot of blood
and seeing the cells.</i>

1313
01:05:55,050 --> 01:05:57,686
<i>And I also see them
as telescopic views</i>

1314
01:05:57,719 --> 01:05:59,755
<i>so that you could be looking
through a telescope</i>

1315
01:05:59,788 --> 01:06:02,590
<i>and then that says something
to me about surveillance,</i>

1316
01:06:02,623 --> 01:06:04,525
<i>seeing something
from a distance.</i>

1317
01:06:04,559 --> 01:06:07,629
<i>I like the suggestions
of all those things.</i>

1318
01:06:07,661 --> 01:06:10,198
<i>It's about discovery.</i>

1319
01:06:10,231 --> 01:06:12,233
<i>And I use dreams in my work.</i>

1320
01:06:12,266 --> 01:06:13,768
<i>Dreams are very important
to me.</i>

1321
01:06:13,802 --> 01:06:15,570
<i>I usually write them down
all the time.</i>

1322
01:06:15,603 --> 01:06:19,140
<i>The dreams are an example
of how the imagination</i>

1323
01:06:19,173 --> 01:06:21,443
<i>can break all boundaries.</i>

1324
01:06:23,077 --> 01:06:24,679
<i>His iconography is based off</i>

1325
01:06:24,713 --> 01:06:28,083
<i>this profound sense he had
that he could try</i>

1326
01:06:28,115 --> 01:06:30,485
<i>to look at the universe.</i>

1327
01:06:30,518 --> 01:06:34,389
<i>Everything organic,</i>

1328
01:06:34,422 --> 01:06:37,291
<i>and everything manmade,</i>

1329
01:06:37,324 --> 01:06:39,127
<i>all the delights,
and all the horrors,</i>

1330
01:06:39,161 --> 01:06:42,030
<i>and trying to put them
together.</i>

1331
01:06:42,063 --> 01:06:46,335
<i>But every aspect of it
would be deeply personal.</i>

1332
01:06:50,739 --> 01:06:52,273
<i>When Peter died,</i>

1333
01:06:52,306 --> 01:06:54,776
<i>David took photographs
of the head,</i>

1334
01:06:54,809 --> 01:06:56,778
<i>the hands, and the feet.</i>

1335
01:06:56,811 --> 01:07:00,548
<i>There's a tradition
of taking death masks</i>

1336
01:07:00,581 --> 01:07:02,384
<i>of someone important.</i>

1337
01:07:02,416 --> 01:07:04,219
<i>Hands are important
because they're how</i>

1338
01:07:04,251 --> 01:07:06,255
<i>you physically interact
with the world.</i>

1339
01:07:06,288 --> 01:07:09,123
<i>And then the feet,
I think are very important.</i>

1340
01:07:09,157 --> 01:07:11,126
<i>And that goes back
to the Old Testament</i>

1341
01:07:11,159 --> 01:07:12,693
<i>and the New Testament.</i>

1342
01:07:12,726 --> 01:07:14,829
<i>How do you read people,
you watch their hands</i>

1343
01:07:14,862 --> 01:07:17,265
<i>but it's more important
you watch their feet</i>

1344
01:07:17,298 --> 01:07:19,300
<i>because that's what's
anchoring you to the world.</i>

1345
01:07:21,135 --> 01:07:23,072
<i>And you find that
all the way through</i>

1346
01:07:23,105 --> 01:07:25,373
<i>classic spiritual literature.</i>

1347
01:07:25,407 --> 01:07:28,510
<i>That iconic letting out
of those images,</i>

1348
01:07:28,543 --> 01:07:30,612
<i>incorporating them into
Peter Hujar Dead</i>

1349
01:07:30,644 --> 01:07:34,750
<i>with that text
is really a call to arms.</i>

1350
01:07:34,782 --> 01:07:37,118
<i>I was diagnosed with ARC
recently</i>

1351
01:07:37,152 --> 01:07:38,653
<i>and this was after
the last few years</i>

1352
01:07:38,686 --> 01:07:40,688
<i>of losing count of the friends
and neighbors</i>

1353
01:07:40,722 --> 01:07:43,492
<i>who've been dying slow,
vicious, unnecessary deaths</i>

1354
01:07:43,525 --> 01:07:45,327
<i>because fags, and dykes,
and junkies</i>

1355
01:07:45,360 --> 01:07:48,130
<i>are expendable in this country.
And at the moment,</i>

1356
01:07:48,163 --> 01:07:50,833
<i>at the moment
I'm a 37-foot tall,</i>

1357
01:07:50,865 --> 01:07:55,503
<i>1,172-pound man
inside this six-foot body,</i>

1358
01:07:55,536 --> 01:07:57,538
<i>and all I could feel
is the pressure.</i>

1359
01:07:57,572 --> 01:08:00,142
<i>All I can feel is the pressure
and the need for relief.</i>

1360
01:08:00,175 --> 01:08:02,277
<i>David? It's Pat.</i>

1361
01:08:02,309 --> 01:08:04,612
<i>It's been too long
and I want you to know</i>

1362
01:08:04,646 --> 01:08:07,149
<i>that I think of you
and I love you a lot,</i>

1363
01:08:07,181 --> 01:08:09,117
<i>and I hope all is well.</i>

1364
01:08:09,150 --> 01:08:10,685
<i>Last night
I talked to my sister</i>

1365
01:08:10,719 --> 01:08:14,690
<i>for the first time
in seven months I think.</i>

1366
01:08:14,722 --> 01:08:17,592
<i>I told her about my diagnosis
and...</i>

1367
01:08:18,859 --> 01:08:21,362
<i>it was rough for me anyway.</i>

1368
01:08:21,395 --> 01:08:23,465
<i>I thought she handled it
pretty well.</i>

1369
01:08:24,865 --> 01:08:27,569
<i>But then who knows.</i>

1370
01:08:27,601 --> 01:08:29,438
<i>I remember Pat
once saying to me,</i>

1371
01:08:29,470 --> 01:08:32,406
<i>she will never get AIDS
or something like that because,</i>

1372
01:08:32,439 --> 01:08:34,342
<i>"I'm not one of those people
that run around</i>

1373
01:08:34,376 --> 01:08:37,246
<i>to have sex with everybody."</i>

1374
01:08:37,279 --> 01:08:39,248
<i>Then I remember
I didn't correct her.</i>

1375
01:08:41,949 --> 01:08:43,751
<i>I mean, how do you begin?</i>

1376
01:08:47,421 --> 01:08:48,523
<i>Dave, you home?</i>

1377
01:08:48,556 --> 01:08:50,126
<i>It's Steve calling again.</i>

1378
01:08:51,259 --> 01:08:52,360
<i>Okay.</i>

1379
01:08:52,394 --> 01:08:54,530
<i>Bye-bye.</i>

1380
01:08:54,563 --> 01:08:57,298
<i>After he had AIDS,
we were fine</i>

1381
01:08:57,332 --> 01:09:00,602
<i>but there came that day
when I called him on the phone</i>

1382
01:09:00,635 --> 01:09:03,472
<i>when I told him our Aunt Helen
was coming to visit.</i>

1383
01:09:03,505 --> 01:09:05,440
<i>Boy, that set him off.</i>

1384
01:09:05,472 --> 01:09:07,775
<i>Look, if it comes up
whether about my girlfriend</i>

1385
01:09:07,809 --> 01:09:09,411
<i>or we have girlfriends,</i>

1386
01:09:09,444 --> 01:09:10,846
<i>I'm gonna tell him
I'm homosexual.</i>

1387
01:09:10,878 --> 01:09:12,247
<i>And if it comes up,
I'll tell him</i>

1388
01:09:12,279 --> 01:09:13,849
<i>that I have this virus.</i>

1389
01:09:13,881 --> 01:09:15,783
<i>If it goes far enough,
I'll fucking confront him</i>

1390
01:09:15,817 --> 01:09:18,287
<i>and ask him why the fuck
they let the psychotic</i>

1391
01:09:18,319 --> 01:09:20,488
<i>do this damage to us
all these fucking years</i>

1392
01:09:20,521 --> 01:09:22,757
<i>and-and not do
a fucking thing about it,</i>

1393
01:09:22,791 --> 01:09:25,293
<i>and like talk about their God
and all this other shit</i>

1394
01:09:25,327 --> 01:09:27,262
<i>when they watched this guy,
what he did to us.</i>

1395
01:09:27,295 --> 01:09:29,597
<i>I'm tired of living these lies
with these people</i>

1396
01:09:29,631 --> 01:09:31,400
<i>and I'm tired of hiding
from these people</i>

1397
01:09:31,432 --> 01:09:32,868
<i>because I'm afraid of who I am</i>

1398
01:09:32,900 --> 01:09:35,237
<i>or because I have problems
with who I am.</i>

1399
01:09:35,270 --> 01:09:36,838
<i>And I'm not gonna
go through it anymore.</i>

1400
01:09:36,871 --> 01:09:38,407
<i>"This is not the place,"
I said,</i>

1401
01:09:38,439 --> 01:09:40,675
<i>"if you wanna confront
Aunt Helen,</i>

1402
01:09:40,708 --> 01:09:43,278
<i>then go to Detroit
and confront her.</i>

1403
01:09:43,310 --> 01:09:44,813
<i>But you're not coming here."</i>

1404
01:09:44,845 --> 01:09:47,248
<i>He went into a rage
that frightened me.</i>

1405
01:09:47,282 --> 01:09:49,418
<i>Don't insult me
by inviting me to come</i>

1406
01:09:49,451 --> 01:09:50,985
<i>after the relatives leave.</i>

1407
01:09:51,019 --> 01:09:53,588
<i>That's right.
Out of sight, okay?</i>

1408
01:09:53,622 --> 01:09:56,490
<i>Get the fuck out of our sight
until it's comfortable,</i>

1409
01:09:56,524 --> 01:09:58,527
<i>until we can deal with you
sitting here</i>

1410
01:09:58,560 --> 01:10:02,664
<i>with your homosexuality,
with your AIDS.</i>

1411
01:10:02,697 --> 01:10:04,498
<i>Yeah, right, sorry for myself.</i>

1412
01:10:04,532 --> 01:10:06,768
<i>I'm the one
who's fucking dying, asshole.</i>

1413
01:10:06,801 --> 01:10:08,937
<i>I'm the one who's got
to fucking confront things</i>

1414
01:10:08,970 --> 01:10:11,440
<i>before I go,
and that's what I wanna do.</i>

1415
01:10:11,472 --> 01:10:13,742
<i>I wanna clear the fear
out of my head.</i>

1416
01:10:13,774 --> 01:10:16,344
<i>It was so painful to me,</i>

1417
01:10:16,377 --> 01:10:18,546
<i>the way that he and I
interacted.</i>

1418
01:10:18,579 --> 01:10:20,448
<i>If I could do it
all over again,</i>

1419
01:10:20,481 --> 01:10:22,850
<i>I-I'd tried to do it
a little differently.</i>

1420
01:10:22,884 --> 01:10:25,453
<i>So, are you afraid to
tell your children I have AIDS?</i>

1421
01:10:25,487 --> 01:10:27,922
<i>And then he starts
saying, "Oh, your kids know</i>

1422
01:10:27,956 --> 01:10:29,824
<i>that you have a faggot
for a brother?"</i>

1423
01:10:29,858 --> 01:10:31,659
<i>That's not what I said.
I said, "Are you afraid</i>

1424
01:10:31,693 --> 01:10:33,395
<i>to tell your kids I have AIDS?"</i>

1425
01:10:33,427 --> 01:10:35,396
<i>And I said,
"David, they're young."</i>

1426
01:10:35,430 --> 01:10:37,633
<i>One's three years old,
the other one's six.</i>

1427
01:10:37,666 --> 01:10:39,701
<i>It's too messy for me
to be in your fucking life,</i>

1428
01:10:39,734 --> 01:10:41,703
<i>so save it. Save it, Steven.</i>

1429
01:10:41,735 --> 01:10:43,305
<i>I don't need this from you.</i>

1430
01:10:43,337 --> 01:10:44,639
<i>I don't need
this kind of insult.</i>

1431
01:10:44,672 --> 01:10:46,541
<i>I fucking face this every day</i>

1432
01:10:46,573 --> 01:10:49,377
<i>and I don't need it
from "family."</i>

1433
01:10:49,411 --> 01:10:50,746
<i>You understand?</i>

1434
01:10:50,779 --> 01:10:52,714
<i>Well, let the conversation end,
Steve.</i>

1435
01:10:52,747 --> 01:10:54,883
<i>We never see each other again.
Goodbye.</i>

1436
01:10:56,850 --> 01:10:58,686
<i>And then,
I never saw him again.</i>

1437
01:11:04,091 --> 01:11:06,527
<i>I'm just feeling
pretty crazy recently,</i>

1438
01:11:06,560 --> 01:11:08,496
<i>lot of anxiety.</i>

1439
01:11:08,529 --> 01:11:11,766
<i>At some point I realize
I was just afraid of dying.</i>

1440
01:11:13,435 --> 01:11:15,604
<i>Throughout all my life
I've tried to maintain</i>

1441
01:11:15,636 --> 01:11:18,606
<i>some kind of complete control
of myself</i>

1442
01:11:18,640 --> 01:11:20,475
<i>and where I've come from.</i>

1443
01:11:20,507 --> 01:11:22,043
<i>All the scenes
as a kid hustling</i>

1444
01:11:22,077 --> 01:11:23,612
<i>and all the scenes
in the streets.</i>

1445
01:11:23,645 --> 01:11:25,614
<i>Sometimes I came close
to death,</i>

1446
01:11:25,646 --> 01:11:28,015
<i>and the times
that I nearly starved,</i>

1447
01:11:28,048 --> 01:11:32,019
<i>maybe a need for self-control,
this... to mask,</i>

1448
01:11:32,052 --> 01:11:36,524
<i>this enormous rage that I carry
or may carry</i>

1449
01:11:36,557 --> 01:11:39,027
<i>from all those experiences.</i>

1450
01:11:39,060 --> 01:11:42,030
<i>I guess I fear loss of
control, let that rage,</i>

1451
01:11:42,063 --> 01:11:44,533
<i>It'll spill
and become indiscriminate</i>

1452
01:11:44,565 --> 01:11:46,702
<i>in terms of what it attacks.</i>

1453
01:11:46,734 --> 01:11:50,438
<i>But really and truly I think
I'm afraid of losing my mind</i>

1454
01:11:50,471 --> 01:11:53,541
<i>at some point
to some degenerative disease</i>

1455
01:11:53,574 --> 01:11:57,479
<i>like meningitis, or seizures,
or whatever.</i>

1456
01:11:57,511 --> 01:12:01,716
<i>I don't wanna lose touch
with words.</i>

1457
01:12:01,750 --> 01:12:05,386
<i>I wanna be able to provoke
some change</i>

1458
01:12:05,420 --> 01:12:07,655
<i>in whatever limited fashion</i>

1459
01:12:07,689 --> 01:12:09,891
<i>in people, in a person.</i>

1460
01:12:09,923 --> 01:12:11,726
<i>And I always had this fantasy</i>

1461
01:12:11,760 --> 01:12:13,795
<i>that if I were
to ever become ill</i>

1462
01:12:13,828 --> 01:12:17,099
<i>and if I were to become so weak
that I couldn't leave the house</i>

1463
01:12:17,131 --> 01:12:19,634
<i>which is another fear for me,</i>

1464
01:12:19,667 --> 01:12:22,504
<i>or at least be able to tap
at a fucking keyboard</i>

1465
01:12:22,537 --> 01:12:24,740
<i>even if it's with a pencil
held between my teeth</i>

1466
01:12:24,773 --> 01:12:27,641
<i>touching each key
letter for letter,</i>

1467
01:12:27,675 --> 01:12:30,078
<i>despite rage, despite illness,</i>

1468
01:12:30,110 --> 01:12:33,414
<i>despite pain,
I hope that my mind...</i>

1469
01:12:34,948 --> 01:12:36,617
<i>...continues.</i>

1470
01:12:38,619 --> 01:12:40,921
<i>AIDS was revealing exactly</i>

1471
01:12:40,954 --> 01:12:43,591
<i>what society was about.</i>

1472
01:12:43,625 --> 01:12:45,659
<i>That was already there
in his work,</i>

1473
01:12:45,693 --> 01:12:48,130
<i>he knew already
what the world was about.</i>

1474
01:12:48,162 --> 01:12:51,098
<i>He knew the structure
that sustained power.</i>

1475
01:12:51,131 --> 01:12:53,701
<i>He knew in the manipulation
of people</i>

1476
01:12:53,734 --> 01:12:55,737
<i>who would like
to live differently.</i>

1477
01:12:55,770 --> 01:12:57,639
<i>So the illness became a weapon</i>

1478
01:12:57,671 --> 01:13:00,541
<i>against politics
of the society.</i>

1479
01:13:00,574 --> 01:13:02,676
<i>When I was diagnosed

01:13:40,914 --> 01:13:43,118

Charging that the government

<i>to the national stage,</i>

<i>total enemy of the state,</i>

1647
01:20:20,514 --> 01:20:24,418
<i>called him that fat cannibal
in skirts</i>

1648
01:20:24,452 --> 01:20:27,155
<i>in the house
of walking swastikas.</i>

1649
01:20:28,355 --> 01:20:31,592
<i>Now, this didn't play well</i>

1650
01:20:31,626 --> 01:20:33,595
<i>with the establishment.</i>

1651
01:20:33,627 --> 01:20:36,130
Tonight, a Manhattan art
exhibit about AIDS

1652
01:20:36,162 --> 01:20:37,898
is losing a lot
of federal money

1653
01:20:37,931 --> 01:20:40,234
because of what
will be shown in the exhibit.

1654
01:20:40,268 --> 01:20:42,203
<i>The chairman of the NEA states,</i>

1655
01:20:42,235 --> 01:20:44,338
<i>"We find that a large portion
of the content</i>

1656
01:20:44,372 --> 01:20:47,075
<i>is political rather than
artistic in nature."</i>

1657
01:20:47,108 --> 01:20:49,543
It's a fact that I maybe
dying of AIDS in 1989.

1658
01:20:49,577 --> 01:20:51,246
Is that not political?

1659
01:20:51,279 --> 01:20:53,147
It's a fact that I don't have
health insurance

1660
01:20:53,180 --> 01:20:55,316
and I don't have access
to adequate healthcare.

1661
01:20:55,349 --> 01:20:58,485
Is that not political?

1662
01:20:58,519 --> 01:21:01,489
And I, you know,
I think that says it clearly.

1663
01:21:01,521 --> 01:21:04,958
<i>This is Washington
and Helms was on a rampage.</i>

1664
01:21:04,992 --> 01:21:07,061
<i>He'd already racked up
Mapplethorpe,</i>

1665
01:21:07,094 --> 01:21:09,264
<i>gotten the Corcoran
to cancel their show.</i>

1666
01:21:09,296 --> 01:21:11,198
<i>He'd already racked up
Piss Christ.</i>

1667
01:21:11,231 --> 01:21:13,100
<i>I mean, this was the time</i>

1668
01:21:13,134 --> 01:21:15,435
<i>and they were looking
for the trifecta,</i>

1669
01:21:15,469 --> 01:21:17,605
<i>the third thing,
and David Wojnarowicz</i>

1670
01:21:17,637 --> 01:21:19,306
<i>was perfect for this.</i>

1671
01:21:19,340 --> 01:21:22,510
This senator is unwilling
to spend one penny.

1672
01:21:22,542 --> 01:21:24,679
I'm saddened to see that, um,

1673
01:21:24,712 --> 01:21:28,116
Congress might not feel
that this show

1674
01:21:28,149 --> 01:21:30,919
should be supported
by the American taxpayer.

1675
01:21:30,952 --> 01:21:33,954
Is this about homophobia
or what is it about?

1676
01:21:33,988 --> 01:21:35,556
I... I'm confused by it.

1677
01:21:35,588 --> 01:21:37,190
What are you thinking about?

1678
01:21:37,224 --> 01:21:39,127
I mean, no. Just that,
uh, you know,

1679
01:21:39,159 --> 01:21:41,395
I'm talking to this
journalist from the Times,

1680
01:21:41,429 --> 01:21:43,463
you know, he said that the NEA
is claiming

1681
01:21:43,497 --> 01:21:45,266
that what I said was horrible,
monstrous,

1682
01:21:45,298 --> 01:21:47,201
you know,
inflammatory, this, that.

1683
01:21:47,234 --> 01:21:49,537
The most terrible things that
they can't even repeat them.

1684
01:21:49,569 --> 01:21:51,972
<i>And I said like, "A study done
on violence</i>

1685
01:21:52,006 --> 01:21:54,676
<i>in America found that
there was increasing numbers</i>

1686
01:21:54,708 --> 01:21:57,010
<i>of homosexual teenagers
that were murdered</i>

1687
01:21:57,043 --> 01:21:58,378
<i>or beaten up.</i>

1688
01:21:58,412 --> 01:22:00,213
And that Dannemeyer
tried to suppress

1689
01:22:00,247 --> 01:22:01,615
that part of the study

1690
01:22:01,649 --> 01:22:03,618
because it contained
the word homosexual.

1691
01:22:03,650 --> 01:22:07,020
<i>Therefore, William Dannemeyer
condones the murder</i>

1692
01:22:07,054 --> 01:22:09,657
<i>and terrorizing
of homosexual teenagers</i>

1693
01:22:09,689 --> 01:22:11,558
and no gesture
I could make could

1694
01:22:11,591 --> 01:22:15,295
even approximate the violence
of what these people have done.

1695
01:22:15,328 --> 01:22:19,299
I'm not gonna sit still
and be silent about it.

1696
01:22:19,332 --> 01:22:21,134
How heroic.

1697
01:22:21,167 --> 01:22:22,670
To the barricades!

1698
01:22:39,052 --> 01:22:40,621
But what's happening now?

1699
01:22:40,654 --> 01:22:42,156
Uh, Susan called up,

1700
01:22:42,189 --> 01:22:43,557
<i>and it turns out that, uh,</i>

1701
01:22:43,591 --> 01:22:45,326
<i>the NEA approached Susan</i>

1702
01:22:45,359 --> 01:22:47,395
<i>and now they're doing
a joint press conference</i>

1703
01:22:47,427 --> 01:22:49,697
issuing statements
and Susan does this paltry

1704
01:22:49,729 --> 01:22:53,033
liberal motherfucking stance
of here,

1705
01:22:53,067 --> 01:22:54,101
"I think there are
certain issues

1706
01:22:54,135 --> 01:22:55,670
that are not resolved here."

1707
01:22:55,703 --> 01:22:57,538
<i>And I said,
"What the fuck are you doing?"</i>

1708
01:22:57,570 --> 01:23:00,675
I said, "These assholes have
themselves against the wall

1709
01:23:00,707 --> 01:23:02,743
over all these issues,
over homophobia,

1710
01:23:02,777 --> 01:23:04,612
legislative silence
of homosexuals

1711
01:23:04,645 --> 01:23:06,481
and lesbians in this country.

1712
01:23:06,514 --> 01:23:08,649
What you're doing is you're
avoiding the whole fucking thing

1713
01:23:08,681 --> 01:23:11,118
for your funding. I said,
"You're a collaborator.

1714
01:23:11,152 --> 01:23:13,221
<i>You and your board
and it's indicative</i>

1715
01:23:13,253 --> 01:23:16,457
of the whole
fucking art world."

1716
01:23:16,489 --> 01:23:18,658
<i>David was more skeptical</i>

1717
01:23:18,692 --> 01:23:20,627
<i>and more negative
about the art world</i>

1718
01:23:20,661 --> 01:23:22,430
<i>than he was about Jesse Helms</i>

1719
01:23:22,462 --> 01:23:24,431
<i>because he thought
that curators of the art world</i>

1720
01:23:24,465 --> 01:23:28,069
<i>hid art with queer ideas</i>

1721
01:23:28,101 --> 01:23:32,206
<i>and just anything that was out
of the White one-tribe nation</i>

1722
01:23:32,238 --> 01:23:34,442
<i>as he said was being censored
by the museums.</i>

1723
01:23:34,475 --> 01:23:37,111
<i>You didn't need Jesse Helms
and people like that</i>

1724
01:23:37,144 --> 01:23:40,614
<i>because the museums were
already doing the job for you.</i>

1725
01:23:40,648 --> 01:23:42,182
Okay, thanks.

1726
01:23:45,653 --> 01:23:46,654
Okay.

1727
01:23:48,255 --> 01:23:49,257
Okay.

1728
01:23:53,359 --> 01:23:54,694
What happened?

1729
01:23:54,728 --> 01:23:56,797
She's fine.
She's, like, uh...

1730
01:23:58,466 --> 01:24:01,469
She said that she could say
in her statement

1731
01:24:01,502 --> 01:24:05,073
that this is a failure
of the government

1732
01:24:05,105 --> 01:24:09,143
to confront homophobia
in the society,

1733
01:24:09,176 --> 01:24:12,447
it's the legislation
into silence of homosexuals.

1734
01:24:12,479 --> 01:24:17,084
And it's the failure to provide
safe sex information

1735
01:24:17,118 --> 01:24:18,419
to people with AIDS so that... uh,

1736
01:24:18,452 --> 01:24:21,389
so they can make
informed decisions.

1737
01:24:22,856 --> 01:24:24,391
Did she say that
to the press?

1738
01:24:24,425 --> 01:24:25,827
This is her statement.

1739
01:24:25,859 --> 01:24:29,830
She's... and that she's gonna
thank me, uh,

1740
01:24:29,863 --> 01:24:31,598
from the bottom of her heart,

1741
01:24:31,631 --> 01:24:34,201
uh, for what she's learned.

1742
01:24:40,407 --> 01:24:43,244
I feel, you know, I feel
pretty emotional about it.

1743
01:24:46,814 --> 01:24:48,349
Oh, man.

1744
01:24:58,158 --> 01:25:00,494
This show does contain
10 years of work

1745
01:25:00,528 --> 01:25:03,664
starting with David's
early street stencil pieces

1746
01:25:03,697 --> 01:25:06,400
to work that was
just made yesterday

1747
01:25:06,432 --> 01:25:07,835
especially for this gallery.

1748
01:25:07,868 --> 01:25:09,403
So without further ado,

1749
01:25:09,435 --> 01:25:11,471
I like to introduce
David Wojnarowicz.

1750
01:25:18,345 --> 01:25:20,780
Thanks a lot for coming tonight.

1751
01:25:20,814 --> 01:25:24,152
I don't think anybody expected
a crowd this big.

1752
01:25:24,185 --> 01:25:25,887
This is kind of strange
and emotional for me

1753
01:25:25,920 --> 01:25:27,387
to be standing in a room

1754
01:25:27,421 --> 01:25:29,824
filled with artifacts
of my life.

1755
01:25:29,856 --> 01:25:31,792
Each painting, photograph,
and sculpture

1756
01:25:31,824 --> 01:25:34,494
has built into it
a particular frame of mind

1757
01:25:34,528 --> 01:25:35,796
that only I can know

1758
01:25:35,828 --> 01:25:37,497
given that I've always
felt alien

1759
01:25:37,530 --> 01:25:40,167
in this country
we call America.

1760
01:25:40,201 --> 01:25:43,337
<i>If I say I'm homosexual,
is that something new to you?</i>

1761
01:25:43,369 --> 01:25:45,372
<i>Does that make you nervous?</i>

1762
01:25:45,405 --> 01:25:47,175
<i>Do you think
it would be a crime,</i>

1763
01:25:47,207 --> 01:25:48,742
<i>the denial of information
only killed people</i>

1764
01:25:48,775 --> 01:25:50,411
<i>that you didn't feel
comfortable with?</i>

1765
01:25:50,444 --> 01:25:51,812
<i>Do you stop to get to know
the person</i>

1766
01:25:51,845 --> 01:25:53,581
<i>you sit or walk next to
in this school?</i>

1767
01:25:53,613 --> 01:25:55,348
<i>Do you make it comfortable
for that person</i>

1768
01:25:55,381 --> 01:25:57,751
<i>to express ideas that
might change your ideas?</i>

1769
01:25:57,784 --> 01:25:59,220
<i>And I wake up every morning.</i>

1770
01:25:59,252 --> 01:26:00,621
<i>I wake up every morning</i>

1771
01:26:00,654 --> 01:26:02,557
<i>to this killing machine
called America.</i>

1772
01:26:02,590 --> 01:26:04,824
<i>And I'm carrying this rage
like a blood-filled egg</i>

1773
01:26:04,858 --> 01:26:08,195
<i>as each T cell disappears
from my body</i>

1774
01:26:08,229 --> 01:26:09,963
<i>and is replaced by
10 pounds of pressure,</i>

1775
01:26:09,997 --> 01:26:11,865
<i>10 pounds of rage.</i>

1776
01:26:11,899 --> 01:26:14,468
<i>And I focus that rage
into non-violent resistance</i>

1777
01:26:14,501 --> 01:26:16,369
<i>but the focus
is starting to slip</i>

1778
01:26:16,403 --> 01:26:18,773
<i>and the egg
is starting to crack.</i>

1779
01:26:18,805 --> 01:26:19,773
<i>Thank you.</i>

1780
01:26:21,408 --> 01:26:23,611
<i>David became the local hero</i>

1781
01:26:23,644 --> 01:26:28,349
<i>in a town that needed a voice
like this so badly.</i>

1782
01:26:28,381 --> 01:26:30,217
<i>When I first went out there,</i>

1783
01:26:30,251 --> 01:26:32,420
<i>I knew that it was like
a fairly conservative town.</i>

1784
01:26:32,453 --> 01:26:34,555
<i>I mean, I had fantasies
of people with pitchforks</i>

1785
01:26:34,587 --> 01:26:35,956
<i>storming the gallery.</i>

1786
01:26:37,925 --> 01:26:39,560
<i>In the days that followed,</i>

1787
01:26:39,592 --> 01:26:40,927
<i>people would come running over
to talk to me</i>

1788
01:26:40,961 --> 01:26:42,797
<i>when they spotted me.</i>

1789
01:26:42,829 --> 01:26:46,800
<i>It was an extremely emotional
positive response.</i>

1790
01:26:46,833 --> 01:26:48,402
<i>I should probably tell you</i>

1791
01:26:48,435 --> 01:26:50,705
<i>how the controversy happened</i>

1792
01:26:50,738 --> 01:26:54,275
<i>about a month into the show.</i>

1793
01:26:54,307 --> 01:26:56,676
<i>There was one page in the book.
It was a black and white,</i>

1794
01:26:56,710 --> 01:27:01,515
<i>homage to Jean Genet
who is one of David's heroes.</i>

1795
01:27:01,547 --> 01:27:03,416
<i>I didn't know it was in color.</i>

1796
01:27:03,449 --> 01:27:04,818
<i>He just gave us the black
and white</i>

1797
01:27:04,851 --> 01:27:07,587
<i>when we put it in the book.</i>

1798
01:27:07,621 --> 01:27:10,958
<i>Jean Genet has a plate over his
head that looks like a halo.</i>

1799
01:27:10,990 --> 01:27:13,560
<i>There's angels with Tommy Guns,</i>

1800
01:27:13,594 --> 01:27:15,596
<i>and in the right-hand corner,</i>

1801
01:27:15,628 --> 01:27:18,698
<i>there's a picture
of Jesus Christ</i>

1802
01:27:18,731 --> 01:27:20,835
<i>with a hypodermic in his arm.</i>

1803
01:27:22,935 --> 01:27:24,804
<i>It didn't make
no never mind to me,</i>

1804
01:27:24,837 --> 01:27:27,942
<i>but one of the people
that got a hold of the book</i>

1805
01:27:27,975 --> 01:27:29,377
<i>was Dana Rohrabacher,</i>

1806
01:27:29,409 --> 01:27:30,510
<i>the right wing politician</i>

1807
01:27:30,543 --> 01:27:33,314
<i>from Orange County, California.</i>

1808
01:27:38,752 --> 01:27:42,990
<i>Rohrabacher put together
a screed</i>

1809
01:27:43,023 --> 01:27:46,761
<i>with a Xerox image of Christ
with the injectable</i>

1810
01:27:46,793 --> 01:27:48,595
<i>talking about,</i>

1811
01:27:48,628 --> 01:27:51,532
<i>"Do you know what your NEA
money is going for?</i>

1812
01:27:51,564 --> 01:27:53,933
<i>15,000 went to a show</i>

1813
01:27:53,966 --> 01:27:58,305
<i>that has anal
and oral homosexual sex,</i>

1814
01:27:58,338 --> 01:27:59,739
<i>it's like a circus.</i>

1815
01:27:59,773 --> 01:28:01,976
<i>This exhibition,
Tongues of Flame,</i>

1816
01:28:02,009 --> 01:28:05,979
<i>is an orgy
of degenerate depravity."</i>

1817
01:28:20,860 --> 01:28:23,797
<i>Then I started getting
letters and threats</i>

1818
01:28:23,831 --> 01:28:26,900
<i>from people
to the university saying,</i>

1819
01:28:26,934 --> 01:28:28,668
<i>"We hear you have
this exhibition</i>

1820
01:28:28,702 --> 01:28:32,039
<i>that is morally unacceptable."</i>

1821
01:28:32,072 --> 01:28:34,074
<i>People would come to the show.</i>

1822
01:28:36,944 --> 01:28:39,547
<i>And I'd end up
having contests with them</i>

1823
01:28:39,579 --> 01:28:41,015
<i>about who can quote
the Bible better,</i>

1824
01:28:41,047 --> 01:28:42,849
<i>me or them.</i>

1825
01:28:42,882 --> 01:28:44,385
<i>I'm trying to explain to them</i>

1826
01:28:44,417 --> 01:28:45,952
<i>that Jesus was
the man of sorrows</i>

1827
01:28:45,985 --> 01:28:48,521
<i>and he was here to cleanse us
of our sins.</i>

1828
01:28:48,555 --> 01:28:51,726
<i>And if that meant
taking on the pain of a junky,</i>

1829
01:28:51,759 --> 01:28:53,828
<i>then that's what Christ
would have to do.</i>

1830
01:29:01,868 --> 01:29:03,403
<i>Then all of a sudden,</i>

1831
01:29:03,436 --> 01:29:06,707
<i>I get a copy
of a two-page pamphlet</i>

1832
01:29:06,739 --> 01:29:10,543
<i>that has excerpts
of David's greatest hits</i>

1833
01:29:10,577 --> 01:29:11,945
<i>from Donald Wildmon</i>

1834
01:29:11,979 --> 01:29:15,883
<i>and the American Family
Association.</i>

1835
01:29:15,916 --> 01:29:20,020
<i>Donald Wildmon got Pepsi
to stop using Madonna</i>

1836
01:29:20,052 --> 01:29:23,657
<i>as a spokesperson because
of cones that she was wearing</i>

1837
01:29:23,689 --> 01:29:26,760
<i>and she was being
anti-religious</i>

1838
01:29:26,793 --> 01:29:28,095
<i>and evidently
that had been sent</i>

1839
01:29:28,127 --> 01:29:30,029
<i>to thousands of church-goers</i>

1840
01:29:30,063 --> 01:29:32,733
<i>and any senator or congressman</i>

1841
01:29:32,765 --> 01:29:35,435
<i>who hadn't gotten it
from Rohrabacher.</i>

1842
01:29:35,469 --> 01:29:38,605
<i>I sent that to David
and I said,</i>

1843
01:29:38,639 --> 01:29:40,074
<i>"Look at this."</i>

1844
01:29:40,106 --> 01:29:43,511
<i>And that's when the shit
hit the fan.</i>

1845
01:29:48,081 --> 01:29:50,083
<i>Coming up,
Wojnarowicz explains</i>

1846
01:29:50,117 --> 01:29:52,653
<i>why he's suing a group
that's trying to cut off</i>

1847
01:29:52,685 --> 01:29:54,487
<i>government funding
of the arts.</i>

1848
01:29:54,520 --> 01:29:56,823
<i>Donald Wildmon went
through a catalogue,</i>

1849
01:29:56,856 --> 01:29:58,626
<i>went through it
with a pair of scissors.</i>

1850
01:29:58,658 --> 01:30:00,927
<i>He searched out
what he perceived to be</i>

1851
01:30:00,961 --> 01:30:03,431
<i>tiny details of paintings
or photographs</i>

1852
01:30:03,463 --> 01:30:06,132
<i>that involved in the portrayal
of sexual activity.</i>

1853
01:30:06,166 --> 01:30:09,837
<i>Sometimes, using less than two
percent of a single painting.</i>

1854
01:30:09,869 --> 01:30:13,940
<i>He represented these mutilated
fragments as my work.</i>

1855
01:30:13,974 --> 01:30:16,944
<i>This week, Wojnarowicz
took Wildmon to court</i>

1856
01:30:16,976 --> 01:30:18,878
<i>for violating his copyright</i>

1857
01:30:18,912 --> 01:30:22,149
<i>and distorting his work
by taking it out of context.</i>

1858
01:30:22,181 --> 01:30:27,153
<i>What I remember
was the whole courtroom</i>

1859
01:30:27,186 --> 01:30:30,457
<i>completely full of artists
and friends of David,</i>

1860
01:30:30,490 --> 01:30:32,493
<i>and Reverend Wildmon
sitting there</i>

1861
01:30:32,525 --> 01:30:35,061
<i>like he was in hell,
like in his mind</i>

1862
01:30:35,095 --> 01:30:36,864
<i>in the most awful place</i>

1863
01:30:36,896 --> 01:30:38,666
<i>that the Lord
could have possibly put him</i>

1864
01:30:38,698 --> 01:30:41,167
<i>there was... full of sinners
and Sodomites</i>

1865
01:30:41,201 --> 01:30:43,203
<i>and blasphemers all around him.</i>

1866
01:30:43,237 --> 01:30:44,872
<i>And people dressed in black.</i>

1867
01:30:44,904 --> 01:30:45,872
<i>And everyone's
dressed in black</i>

1868
01:30:45,905 --> 01:30:47,541
<i>and he looked tortured.</i>

1869
01:31:01,889 --> 01:31:05,025
<i>This is something
that I argued with David about</i>

1870
01:31:05,057 --> 01:31:07,560
<i>numerous times.
And David was sick.</i>

1871
01:31:07,594 --> 01:31:11,030
<i>I said to him, "You know, you
don't have this time to waste.</i>

1872
01:31:11,064 --> 01:31:13,000
<i>You're not gonna change
their minds.</i>

1873
01:31:13,033 --> 01:31:14,902
<i>They don't have minds.</i>

1874
01:31:14,935 --> 01:31:17,137
<i>The so-called ideas
of these people like Wildmon,</i>

1875
01:31:17,170 --> 01:31:18,838
<i>they're not ideas.</i>

1876
01:31:18,872 --> 01:31:21,242
<i>They are aspects of bigotry.</i>

1877
01:31:21,274 --> 01:31:23,009
<i>There are always people
like this.</i>

1878
01:31:23,042 --> 01:31:24,944
<i>Sometimes they're more powerful
than others."</i>

1879
01:31:24,978 --> 01:31:27,981
<i>That was a moment of power
for those kind of churches</i>

1880
01:31:28,015 --> 01:31:30,684
<i>and those kind of people.
We're in one now, again.</i>

1881
01:31:30,716 --> 01:31:32,719
<i>But in between,
they lost power.</i>

1882
01:31:32,752 --> 01:31:36,523
<i>And in the end, they never have
the power as an artist.</i>

1883
01:31:36,556 --> 01:31:38,692
<i>David Wojnarowicz
is more valuable</i>

1884
01:31:38,725 --> 01:31:40,794
<i>than every one of these
preachers that ever lived</i>

1885
01:31:40,827 --> 01:31:45,266
<i>as a person and as what
he put into the world.</i>

1886
01:31:45,298 --> 01:31:48,034
<i>David was being cast
as that angry young man</i>

1887
01:31:48,068 --> 01:31:50,538
<i>who was just screaming
all the time.</i>

1888
01:31:50,570 --> 01:31:54,007
<i>And people had told him
that he was not a good painter.</i>

1889
01:31:59,579 --> 01:32:01,180
<i>So, he was challenging himself</i>

1890
01:32:01,213 --> 01:32:04,952
<i>to make beautiful paintings
of flowers.</i>

1891
01:32:04,984 --> 01:32:07,787
<i>But within that, of course,
he put his writing.</i>

1892
01:32:07,820 --> 01:32:12,792
<i>And he did it in a way
that melded with the pictures.</i>

1893
01:32:12,826 --> 01:32:14,828
<i>But as you read the works,</i>

1894
01:32:14,860 --> 01:32:16,262
<i>you realized
he was telling stories</i>

1895
01:32:16,296 --> 01:32:19,667
<i>of death and politics.</i>

1896
01:32:19,699 --> 01:32:22,970
<i>I mean, it's just a really sad,
beautiful show.</i>

1897
01:32:25,005 --> 01:32:27,740
I wonder what this
little bug does in the world,

1898
01:32:27,774 --> 01:32:29,644
what his job is.

1899
01:32:31,877 --> 01:32:34,948
And if this little bug dies,

1900
01:32:34,981 --> 01:32:36,850
if the world feels it,

1901
01:32:36,882 --> 01:32:38,652
I mean,
does the Earth feel it?

1902
01:32:38,685 --> 01:32:42,056
Does the world get a little
lighter in the rotation?

1903
01:32:42,088 --> 01:32:43,858
There's another one here.

1904
01:32:45,359 --> 01:32:48,596
So, you think they're married?

1905
01:32:48,628 --> 01:32:51,666
Or are they homosexuals
on vacation?

1906
01:32:54,266 --> 01:32:57,304
<i>David was HIV-positive in '88.</i>

1907
01:32:57,337 --> 01:33:00,341
<i>I went to New York a lot,
a lot of the time,</i>

1908
01:33:00,373 --> 01:33:03,010
<i>to work with him until 1991.</i>

1909
01:33:03,042 --> 01:33:06,947
<i>I mean, for me, he wasn't sick.</i>

1910
01:33:06,979 --> 01:33:10,884
<i>You couldn't see on his face,
on his body he was sick.</i>

1911
01:33:10,917 --> 01:33:13,053
<i>Until the last trip we did,</i>

1912
01:33:13,086 --> 01:33:17,958
<i>there's one moment where I felt
this virus took his mind.</i>

1913
01:33:22,029 --> 01:33:26,266
<i>May 1991, we did
this trip in the Southwest.</i>

1914
01:33:30,170 --> 01:33:32,640
<i>We were in Death Valley driving</i>

1915
01:33:32,672 --> 01:33:34,807
<i>and I said to David,
"Let's stop here.</i>

1916
01:33:34,841 --> 01:33:38,078
<i>I would like to take photos."</i>

1917
01:33:38,110 --> 01:33:40,814
<i>David said, "Look,
I'm not really feeling good.</i>

1918
01:33:40,846 --> 01:33:42,649
<i>I stay in the car. Go on.</i>

1919
01:33:42,682 --> 01:33:44,283
<i>I just want to stay here."</i>

1920
01:33:48,320 --> 01:33:51,125
<i>I don't know.
Maybe I left half hour.</i>

1921
01:33:54,094 --> 01:33:55,996
<i>Then I came back to the car</i>

1922
01:33:56,029 --> 01:34:00,668
<i>and David was laying down
with the seat down.</i>

1923
01:34:00,701 --> 01:34:02,670
<i>He was, like...</i>

1924
01:34:02,703 --> 01:34:06,073
<i>white, completely white.</i>

1925
01:34:06,105 --> 01:34:08,742
<i>I said, "David."
And he didn't answer to me.</i>

1926
01:34:08,774 --> 01:34:10,009
<i>He wasn't sleeping.</i>

1927
01:34:10,042 --> 01:34:11,878
<i>His eyes were open.</i>

1928
01:34:11,912 --> 01:34:15,115
<i>And then he looked at me</i>

1929
01:34:15,148 --> 01:34:17,885
<i>and he wasn't there.</i>

1930
01:34:17,917 --> 01:34:21,087
<i>He was somewhere.
I don't know where.</i>

1931
01:34:21,121 --> 01:34:23,090
<i>I started getting scared.</i>

1932
01:34:23,122 --> 01:34:27,960
<i>I touched his face saying,
"David, David, David, David."</i>

1933
01:34:27,993 --> 01:34:31,030
<i>And then he came back slowly
to consciousness</i>

1934
01:34:31,064 --> 01:34:34,101
<i>and then he started laughing
like nothing happened,</i>

1935
01:34:34,134 --> 01:34:38,939
<i>like he was nowhere,
like he has been here.</i>

1936
01:34:38,971 --> 01:34:42,242
<i>That's the moment
I felt that, uh,</i>

1937
01:34:42,274 --> 01:34:45,412
<i>something was shifting
in his mind.</i>

1938
01:34:50,149 --> 01:34:52,819
<i>Actually,
I blanked and I,</i>

1939
01:34:52,853 --> 01:34:55,456
<i>you know,
my memory seems to come and go.</i>

1940
01:34:55,488 --> 01:34:58,157
<i>I... I forget so many things,
uh, these days</i>

1941
01:34:58,190 --> 01:35:00,159
<i>where it just seems
huge blocks of time</i>

1942
01:35:00,193 --> 01:35:01,929
<i>are suddenly gone and then...</i>

1943
01:35:01,962 --> 01:35:04,098
- <i>David.</i>
- <i>...they come back.</i>

1944
01:35:06,966 --> 01:35:10,304
<i>The same trip David
took his camera and he said,</i>

1945
01:35:10,337 --> 01:35:12,906
<i>"I would like you
to take a photo of me,</i>

1946
01:35:12,939 --> 01:35:16,944
<i>like, if I was buried."</i>

1947
01:35:16,976 --> 01:35:21,081
<i>So, we silently start digging</i>

1948
01:35:21,113 --> 01:35:24,284
<i>and I cover him with sand
and earth.</i>

1949
01:35:29,221 --> 01:35:33,092
<i>I took different photos.
I took photos from behind.</i>

1950
01:35:33,126 --> 01:35:35,429
<i>It was very strong,
very strong.</i>

1951
01:35:48,140 --> 01:35:51,411
<i>And that was the last
trip we did together.</i>

1952
01:35:51,444 --> 01:35:53,213
<i>We never met again.</i>

1953
01:35:53,246 --> 01:35:56,283
<i>We spoke over the phone,
but we never met again.</i>

1954
01:36:06,025 --> 01:36:09,529
<i>I guess it was about
September of '91.</i>

1955
01:36:09,563 --> 01:36:11,864
<i>He called me
in the middle of the night,</i>

1956
01:36:11,898 --> 01:36:13,967
<i>probably around 2:00
in the morning.</i>

1957
01:36:14,000 --> 01:36:16,970
<i>He said that he had a fever
and he was shaking.</i>

1958
01:36:17,002 --> 01:36:18,871
<i>And so, I came over.</i>

1959
01:36:18,904 --> 01:36:20,239
<i>I put him under a quilt</i>

1960
01:36:20,273 --> 01:36:22,275
<i>and he was just
really shivering,</i>

1961
01:36:22,309 --> 01:36:23,877
<i>like, he couldn't stop.</i>

1962
01:36:23,909 --> 01:36:25,144
<i>And that was
the beginning of it.</i>

1963
01:36:25,177 --> 01:36:27,547
<i>That was the start of it.</i>

1964
01:36:27,581 --> 01:36:30,050
<i>From then on,
things started to slowly</i>

1965
01:36:30,082 --> 01:36:32,051
<i>but surely go downhill.</i>

1966
01:36:32,085 --> 01:36:34,822
<i>He was hospitalized
for eight to ten days.</i>

1967
01:36:34,854 --> 01:36:38,057
<i>They did tests,
but then he went home.</i>

1968
01:36:38,091 --> 01:36:39,526
<i>And literally, from then on,</i>

1969
01:36:39,559 --> 01:36:42,162
<i>he was never really much
out of bed.</i>

1970
01:36:42,194 --> 01:36:43,896
<i>Hi, David,
Penny Arcade.</i>

1971
01:36:43,930 --> 01:36:47,067
<i>I have a friend
who's on the board of directors</i>

1972
01:36:47,100 --> 01:36:48,869
<i>for The Museum of Modern Art.</i>

1973
01:36:48,902 --> 01:36:51,371
<i>He's interested in getting
Peter into the museum.</i>

1974
01:36:51,404 --> 01:36:53,106
<i>Call me
so I can talk to you, okay?</i>

1975
01:36:53,139 --> 01:36:55,242
<i>Bye.</i>

1976
01:37:09,989 --> 01:37:12,492
<i>When U2 did a concert
out at the Meadowlands</i>

1977
01:37:12,524 --> 01:37:15,362
<i>in New Jersey,
they sent a limousine for us.</i>

1978
01:37:15,395 --> 01:37:18,265
<i>And before the concert,
we met with them.</i>

1979
01:37:18,297 --> 01:37:20,233
<i>Bono wanted to know
if we wanted to pray with them.</i>

1980
01:37:20,266 --> 01:37:21,902
<i>We said, "No.
I think we'll pass on that.</i>

1981
01:37:21,935 --> 01:37:23,170
<i>Thank you."</i>

1982
01:37:26,206 --> 01:37:27,574
<i>But it was just so special.</i>

1983
01:37:27,606 --> 01:37:29,009
<i>I mean, he was thrilled.</i>

1984
01:37:29,042 --> 01:37:31,511
<i>He was really,
truly thrilled.</i>

1985
01:37:31,543 --> 01:37:33,313
<i>Hi, David. It's Kiki.</i>

1986
01:37:33,345 --> 01:37:35,348
<i>Siobhan says that you went back
in the hospital.</i>

1987
01:37:35,381 --> 01:37:37,049
<i>So, I hope you're okay.</i>

1988
01:37:37,082 --> 01:37:38,885
<i>He was in
and out of Cabrini</i>

1989
01:37:38,918 --> 01:37:40,220
<i>a number of times.</i>

1990
01:37:40,252 --> 01:37:41,889
<i>And after one of them,
he said,</i>

1991
01:37:41,921 --> 01:37:44,924
<i>"I'm never going back again."</i>

1992
01:37:44,957 --> 01:37:47,260
<i>Homecare was established
in that loft</i>

1993
01:37:47,293 --> 01:37:49,896
<i>of the movie theater for him.</i>

1994
01:37:49,930 --> 01:37:51,899
<i>That became a hospital room.</i>

1995
01:37:51,931 --> 01:37:54,333
<i>And most patients
didn't have that at that time.</i>

1996
01:37:54,367 --> 01:37:56,336
<i>David was one
of the first people</i>

1997
01:37:56,368 --> 01:37:58,337
<i>to have that level of homecare.</i>

1998
01:37:58,371 --> 01:38:01,307
<i>And probably that was the force
of his personality</i>

1999
01:38:01,341 --> 01:38:04,177
<i>and Tom's
organizational skills.</i>

2000
01:38:04,210 --> 01:38:06,413
<i>If not for Tom,
that wouldn't have happened.</i>

2001
01:38:07,680 --> 01:38:11,018
<i>David? Dave?</i>

2002
01:38:11,051 --> 01:38:12,419
<i>Hello?</i>

2003
01:38:12,452 --> 01:38:14,221
<i>It's Pat.</i>

2004
01:38:14,253 --> 01:38:17,090
<i>I just want to let you know,
I talked to Tom</i>

2005
01:38:17,122 --> 01:38:19,259
<i>and I told him when
I'm coming in.</i>

2006
01:38:19,292 --> 01:38:22,996
<i>I'm worried about you.
I hope...</i>

2007
01:38:23,029 --> 01:38:25,098
<i>I just hope that
you have someone around you</i>

2008
01:38:25,131 --> 01:38:29,101
<i>and, uh, well, I'll talk to you
tomorrow, okay?</i>

2009
01:38:29,135 --> 01:38:32,039
<i>Big kiss. Bye-bye.</i>

2010
01:38:32,072 --> 01:38:34,307
<i>His decline was speeding up.</i>

2011
01:38:34,341 --> 01:38:36,043
<i>Dementia was setting in.</i>

2012
01:38:36,076 --> 01:38:37,577
<i>It was in and out.</i>

2013
01:38:37,609 --> 01:38:39,278
<i>It was getting
more and more difficult</i>

2014
01:38:39,311 --> 01:38:41,180
<i>and he was more and more
tired.</i>

2015
01:38:44,083 --> 01:38:45,952
<i>Things were happening
for David.</i>

2016
01:38:45,985 --> 01:38:48,287
<i>And you could tell David
that MoMA had just bought Fire</i>

2017
01:38:48,320 --> 01:38:49,422
<i>and he was just kind of like,</i>

2018
01:38:49,456 --> 01:38:52,192
<i>"That's wonderful."</i>

2019
01:38:52,225 --> 01:38:54,361
<i>And you could tell him
five minutes later</i>

2020
01:38:54,394 --> 01:38:56,496
<i>and he would not remember.
It was like Groundhog Day,</i>

2021
01:38:56,529 --> 01:38:58,332
<i>you could just absolutely
tell him the same thing over.</i>

2022
01:38:58,364 --> 01:39:00,500
<i>And he had absolute happiness.</i>

2023
01:39:02,469 --> 01:39:05,137
<i>It was a very beautiful
wide-eyed David.</i>

2024
01:39:05,171 --> 01:39:06,539
<i>It wasn't like it wasn't him.</i>

2025
01:39:06,573 --> 01:39:08,041
<i>But he was joyous.</i>

2026
01:39:10,275 --> 01:39:12,278
<i>Dr. Bob said,
"A real person comes out</i>

2027
01:39:12,311 --> 01:39:14,081
<i>when they get into dementia.</i>

2028
01:39:14,113 --> 01:39:15,982
<i>If they're nasty at core,
they'll be nasty."</i>

2029
01:39:16,015 --> 01:39:19,719
<i>But David was as sweet
as he could be.</i>

2030
01:39:19,752 --> 01:39:22,021
<i>It was heartbreaking for me.</i>

2031
01:39:22,055 --> 01:39:23,990
<i>He didn't think anybody
would stick around</i>

2032
01:39:24,024 --> 01:39:25,425
<i>if he got sick
or he was dying.</i>

2033
01:39:25,457 --> 01:39:27,493
<i>He was very much afraid
of that</i>

2034
01:39:27,527 --> 01:39:30,697
<i>and I think as a result of how
badly he was treated as a kid.</i>

2035
01:39:30,729 --> 01:39:33,099
<i>You know, there was
a tremendous sadness and fear</i>

2036
01:39:33,132 --> 01:39:34,701
<i>for me worrying about him</i>

2037
01:39:34,734 --> 01:39:38,005
<i>and knowing he was just
getting worse and worse.</i>

2038
01:39:38,037 --> 01:39:40,172
<i>But at the same time,
I felt grateful</i>

2039
01:39:40,206 --> 01:39:42,275
<i>that I could be there for him.</i>

2040
01:39:45,145 --> 01:39:47,214
<i>Looking out the windows,
I can place myself</i>

2041
01:39:47,247 --> 01:39:49,383
<i>somewhere out in that sky,</i>

2042
01:39:49,416 --> 01:39:51,083
<i>lie down in that texture</i>

2043
01:39:51,117 --> 01:39:55,188
<i>and dream of years
and years of sleep.</i>

2044
01:39:55,220 --> 01:39:57,690
<i>And I... and I talk.</i>

2045
01:39:57,724 --> 01:39:59,525
<i>And I talk inside
my head of change</i>

2046
01:39:59,559 --> 01:40:02,096
<i>and of peace for this body
beside me.</i>

2047
01:40:06,399 --> 01:40:08,635
<i>Smell the flowers
while you can.</i>

2048
01:40:13,305 --> 01:40:17,076
<i>July 22nd,
he died at the apartment.</i>

2049
01:40:17,109 --> 01:40:20,046
<i>And there were like
12 of us there,</i>

2050
01:40:20,079 --> 01:40:22,716
<i>all of his friends,
his sister.</i>

2051
01:40:22,748 --> 01:40:26,153
<i>The nurse said to Tom,
"I think he's gone."</i>

2052
01:40:26,185 --> 01:40:28,721
<i>And, um...</i>

2053
01:40:28,755 --> 01:40:31,391
<i>that was it.</i>

2054
01:40:34,793 --> 01:40:38,064
<i>It's no one thing
that took David's life,</i>

2055
01:40:38,097 --> 01:40:39,533
<i>it was the burden of carrying</i>

2056
01:40:39,565 --> 01:40:42,501
<i>all those illnesses
in that one body</i>

2057
01:40:42,534 --> 01:40:45,439
<i>that was just too much
for one body to bear.</i>

2058
01:40:52,444 --> 01:40:54,180
<i>There were a lot of tears
during that time.</i>

2059
01:40:54,213 --> 01:40:56,182
<i>There were a lot of tears then.</i>

2060
01:40:56,216 --> 01:40:58,618
<i>But I've gained a great deal
of distance now, of course.</i>

2061
01:40:58,650 --> 01:41:01,253
<i>And you know, in some ways,
it's even hard to remember him</i>

2062
01:41:01,287 --> 01:41:03,256
<i>which I don't like.</i>

2063
01:41:03,288 --> 01:41:05,826
<i>It's what time does to you.</i>

2064
01:41:05,859 --> 01:41:07,394
But he's always here.

2065
01:41:07,426 --> 01:41:09,628
You know, he's always here
no matter what.

2066
01:41:09,662 --> 01:41:11,164
I know he's here.

2067
01:41:48,868 --> 01:41:52,305
Oh, my God. Here we are.

2068
01:41:52,337 --> 01:41:55,774
I said I wasn't going to cry
and I'm already tearing up.

2069
01:41:55,807 --> 01:41:58,377
It has been so long coming.

2070
01:42:02,347 --> 01:42:03,583
Here it is.

2071
01:42:06,519 --> 01:42:08,188
<i>It's a little overwhelming,
isn't it?</i>

2072
01:42:08,220 --> 01:42:09,455
Wow.

2073
01:42:11,256 --> 01:42:13,425
Look at all of this.

2074
01:42:13,458 --> 01:42:15,228
All the Peter Hujar
dreaming photos.

2075
01:42:15,261 --> 01:42:16,863
- Yeah.
- Peter was quite

2076
01:42:16,895 --> 01:42:19,599
an extraordinary character
and they were so connected.

2077
01:42:19,631 --> 01:42:20,666
Yeah.

2078
01:42:20,699 --> 01:42:21,934
Anita, there's your monkey.

2079
01:42:21,967 --> 01:42:23,302
There's your monkey, sweetie.

2080
01:42:23,336 --> 01:42:25,338
Oh. Yes, it is.

2081
01:42:25,371 --> 01:42:27,274
David painted it for Peter.

2082
01:42:27,306 --> 01:42:29,208
And it was over his bed
while he was sick.

2083
01:42:29,242 --> 01:42:30,543
- Yes.
- And when he died,

2084
01:42:30,577 --> 01:42:32,244
they... he gave it to Anita.

2085
01:42:32,278 --> 01:42:34,213
- Kept it for 20 years.
- Yeah.

2086
01:42:34,247 --> 01:42:37,517
And I'm so sorry
I needed to sell it.

2087
01:42:37,550 --> 01:42:39,853
If I could buy it back
from that woman, I would.

2088
01:42:39,886 --> 01:42:42,689
Peter would always say
that the monkey was carrying

2089
01:42:42,721 --> 01:42:44,890
<i>the weight of the world
on his shoulders</i>

2090
01:42:44,923 --> 01:42:47,927
the way David did it.

2091
01:42:47,961 --> 01:42:49,729
This has always
been a favorite.

2092
01:42:49,761 --> 01:42:50,963
When I first saw it,

2093
01:42:50,997 --> 01:42:53,365
it really kind of
moved me a lot.

2094
01:42:53,399 --> 01:42:55,735
At that point,
David was not feeling very well

2095
01:42:55,768 --> 01:42:59,372
and I just kept thinking
of extinction and Wojnarowicz.

2096
01:42:59,404 --> 01:43:01,373
He's so clever.
He really was.

2097
01:43:01,407 --> 01:43:04,511
He had such a great
childish imagination.

2098
01:43:07,579 --> 01:43:10,649
<i>Imagination is the key
