2
00:00:38,645 --> 00:00:39,937
Based on a true story.

3
00:00:40,144 --> 00:00:42,144
Will the defendant please stand?

4
00:00:43,000 --> 00:00:43,958
Kempton Bunton,

5
00:00:44,000 --> 00:00:47,750
you are charged
set on the 21st March 1961,

6
00:00:47,833 --> 00:00:50,042
you stole from the National Gallery,

7
00:00:50,208 --> 00:00:55,167
the Portrait of the Duke of Wellington
by the artist, Francisco Goya,

8
00:00:55,375 --> 00:00:58,542
to the value of
one hundred and forty thousand pounds.

9
00:00:58,583 --> 00:01:00,958
How do you plead,
guilty or not guilty?

10
00:01:01,000 --> 00:01:01,833
Not guilty.

11
00:01:01,958 --> 00:01:03,917
And that you created a public nuisance

12
00:01:03,917 --> 00:01:07,917
by depriving members of the public
of the opportunity to view the portrait.

13
00:01:08,000 --> 00:01:10,208
Do you plead guilty or not guilty?

14
00:01:10,375 --> 00:01:11,792
Same again, luv, not guilty.

15
00:01:14,333 --> 00:01:15,292
Mr. Cussen.

16
00:01:16,750 --> 00:01:18,125
Thank you, My Lord.

17
00:01:18,750 --> 00:01:21,583
Six months earlier

18
00:01:24,875 --> 00:01:27,708
Newcastle, 1961

19
00:02:02,458 --> 00:02:06,208
BBC TV

20
00:02:18,333 --> 00:02:24,208
The Duke

21
00:02:24,292 --> 00:02:26,568
At this rate,
you'll be giving that Shakespeare

22
00:02:26,592 --> 00:02:27,625
a run for his money.

23
00:02:27,883 --> 00:02:31,383
Imagine if Jesus had been born a woman.

24
00:02:32,708 --> 00:02:35,792
- What's it called?
- The adventures of "Susan Christ".

25
00:02:37,792 --> 00:02:39,417
Not my cup of tea then.

26
00:02:40,167 --> 00:02:41,667
Oh, well, you never know.

27
00:02:41,708 --> 00:02:43,000
Recorded delivery?

28
00:02:44,125 --> 00:02:45,375
Aye. Good idea.

29
00:02:45,833 --> 00:02:47,356
That'll be two shillings, Mr. Bunton.

30
00:02:48,208 --> 00:02:50,958
Come on, Mr. Singh,
I know you're in there.

31
00:02:52,375 --> 00:02:53,750
I know he's in.

32
00:02:55,042 --> 00:02:57,375
- Harry.
- Alright.

33
00:02:57,417 --> 00:02:58,292
We'll come back.

34
00:02:58,375 --> 00:02:59,917
- I know he's in.
- Right.

35
00:03:00,000 --> 00:03:01,000
He's cooking.

36
00:03:01,292 --> 00:03:03,917
All right, cup of tea
and then we're gonna go.

37
00:03:04,125 --> 00:03:05,708
<i>"Evening Chronicle," how can I help you?</i>

38
00:03:05,733 --> 00:03:07,167
Is Barry Spence there, pet?

39
00:03:07,303 --> 00:03:09,375
- Just putting through.
- Thank you.

40
00:03:11,773 --> 00:03:12,892
Dorothy.

41
00:03:12,917 --> 00:03:14,000
I'm in here.

42
00:03:14,333 --> 00:03:17,042
Dorothy, would you be a sweetie,
and just clean the heads for me?

43
00:03:17,692 --> 00:03:18,958
Oh, yes. Yes, of course.

44
00:03:19,167 --> 00:03:20,667
Will I finish the fire place first?

45
00:03:20,667 --> 00:03:22,784
It's entirely up to you,
but I'm playing this afternoon.

46
00:03:22,855 --> 00:03:23,690
Busy, busy.

47
00:03:23,833 --> 00:03:26,417
Dorothy, as I was passing Phoenix
the other day

48
00:03:26,792 --> 00:03:28,875
I noticed that they had
a sign of

49
00:03:29,167 --> 00:03:30,000
Storeman.

50
00:03:30,208 --> 00:03:31,667
Just in case your husband...

51
00:03:35,208 --> 00:03:37,167
I just mention it...

52
00:03:57,250 --> 00:03:59,333
- Mr. Bunton.
- The curtain's raised.

53
00:04:04,750 --> 00:04:05,583
Dad.

54
00:04:08,542 --> 00:04:10,667
- Post office, in the street?
- I know.

55
00:04:11,167 --> 00:04:13,000
- Buy me five minutes.
<i>- Mr. Bunton.</i>

56
00:04:13,042 --> 00:04:14,833
Come with the hour, Jackie lad.

57
00:04:15,708 --> 00:04:16,833
Mr. Bunton.

58
00:04:17,416 --> 00:04:19,025
- Can I help?
- We're here to inspect

59
00:04:19,064 --> 00:04:20,208
your television license.

60
00:04:23,667 --> 00:04:24,625
Look at that.

61
00:04:25,417 --> 00:04:26,958
- What?
- Fox.

62
00:04:27,583 --> 00:04:28,417
Big fella.

63
00:04:28,458 --> 00:04:31,375
Any house with a television
is required to have a license.

64
00:04:31,708 --> 00:04:35,875
Our radar van detected a line output
transformer signal from this address.

65
00:04:35,958 --> 00:04:38,500
Coming from a cathode-ray tube
this time last week.

66
00:04:38,965 --> 00:04:40,792
- I haven't got one of them.
- That's a telly.

67
00:04:42,125 --> 00:04:43,125
Oh, we got one of them.

68
00:04:43,750 --> 00:04:45,000
And do you have a license?

69
00:04:45,958 --> 00:04:48,042
- In what sense?
- In a sense of having one,

70
00:04:49,042 --> 00:04:50,250
or not having one.

71
00:04:54,042 --> 00:04:56,750
Gentlemen, join me,
"Robin Hood" after the adverts.

72
00:04:56,750 --> 00:04:58,708
- Can we see your license, sir?
- Don't need one.

73
00:04:58,750 --> 00:05:01,333
We only watch ITV,
which is paid for by this.

74
00:05:01,417 --> 00:05:02,187
This is a mistake.

75
00:05:02,250 --> 00:05:04,009
I can go to the post
office in the morning.

76
00:05:04,033 --> 00:05:05,945
This is not a mistake,
that is a political act.

77
00:05:06,167 --> 00:05:09,208
Witness,
I cannot receive the BBC.

78
00:05:09,250 --> 00:05:11,167
To the left, ITV.

79
00:05:11,750 --> 00:05:14,667
I've taken the band-1 coil
from the turret tuner.

80
00:05:14,708 --> 00:05:15,708
Here we go again.

81
00:05:15,792 --> 00:05:18,125
My wife always supports me in private.

82
00:05:18,333 --> 00:05:20,338
It is thus physically impossible,

83
00:05:20,417 --> 00:05:22,125
for this set to receive
a televisual signal

84
00:05:22,167 --> 00:05:24,333
from the British Broadcasting Corporation.

85
00:05:24,417 --> 00:05:27,042
That negates the imperative on me
to pay the license.

86
00:05:27,125 --> 00:05:29,625
I've only got 16 bob here.
Jackie, fetch the

87
00:05:29,708 --> 00:05:30,750
- kit keys from the--
- Don't you move.

88
00:05:30,792 --> 00:05:32,292
It's an unfair tax

89
00:05:32,292 --> 00:05:33,792
on ordinary people,

90
00:05:33,875 --> 00:05:36,250
especially the oldies
that can't afford it.

91
00:05:36,458 --> 00:05:37,667
Television, gentlemen,

92
00:05:37,917 --> 00:05:39,792
is the modern cure for loneliness.

93
00:05:39,875 --> 00:05:41,333
- We are a movement.
- I'm not.

94
00:05:41,333 --> 00:05:43,248
Our aim is to persuade our government

95
00:05:43,272 --> 00:05:46,125
that all people should have
free televisual viewing.

96
00:05:46,167 --> 00:05:48,583
Well, the law is the law,
and no one is above it.

97
00:05:48,583 --> 00:05:50,150
Especially a nobody like you.

98
00:05:50,250 --> 00:05:53,042
Oi! You can't talk to my dad like that
in his own house.

99
00:05:53,125 --> 00:05:54,750
- Or what?
- You all right, Kempton?

100
00:05:54,833 --> 00:05:56,292
Don't know, Barry,
Never think about it.

101
00:05:56,333 --> 00:05:58,167
You, back again, stirring it?

102
00:05:58,208 --> 00:05:59,583
- Who are you?
- "Evening Chronicle."

103
00:05:59,625 --> 00:06:02,042
- By statute...
- Free TV for the OAP.

104
00:06:02,792 --> 00:06:03,458
I like it.

105
00:06:03,542 --> 00:06:04,500
I was pleased.

106
00:06:04,542 --> 00:06:06,042
Not a lot range with TV.

107
00:06:06,042 --> 00:06:07,375
I don't want this in the papers.

108
00:06:07,375 --> 00:06:08,833
He does, that's why I'm here.

109
00:06:08,833 --> 00:06:12,708
By statute, anyone owning a television
needs a license.

110
00:06:13,125 --> 00:06:15,000
But I have modified this set,

111
00:06:15,208 --> 00:06:17,708
by removing the BBC coil.

112
00:06:17,708 --> 00:06:19,750
So I owe the government nothing.

113
00:06:20,167 --> 00:06:24,500
That is an unarguable proposition,
and certainly sound in law.

114
00:06:24,583 --> 00:06:25,333
Hold it.

115
00:06:27,333 --> 00:06:30,042
HM PRISON, DURHAM

116
00:06:30,125 --> 00:06:30,958
Thank you.

117
00:06:46,125 --> 00:06:47,042
Sorry, dad.

118
00:06:48,833 --> 00:06:50,250
Where to? Home?

119
00:06:50,333 --> 00:06:51,458
To Marian's.

120
00:07:01,292 --> 00:07:02,292
Sorry, love.

121
00:07:04,917 --> 00:07:05,750
Porridge.

122
00:07:08,208 --> 00:07:09,583
Thirteen days.

123
00:07:12,917 --> 00:07:14,042
Broke the law,

124
00:07:17,042 --> 00:07:18,333
upset your mother,

125
00:07:19,417 --> 00:07:20,208
again.

126
00:07:23,667 --> 00:07:29,208
Marian Bunton
1930-1948

127
00:07:29,375 --> 00:07:30,667
Why doesn't mum ever come?

128
00:07:31,000 --> 00:07:33,250
I don't know, Jackie,
you have to ask her that yourself.

129
00:07:40,042 --> 00:07:44,125
When England faces the Waterloo
one man stood firm,

130
00:07:44,208 --> 00:07:45,167
this man,

131
00:07:45,542 --> 00:07:47,958
Arthur Wellesley, the Duke of Wellington.

132
00:07:48,000 --> 00:07:49,071
And when last week,

133
00:07:49,095 --> 00:07:52,333
this historic portrait was in danger
of leaving the country forever

134
00:07:52,333 --> 00:07:54,125
we also stood firm.

135
00:07:54,417 --> 00:07:59,542
Raising a hundred and forty thousand pounds
required to secure it for us all.

136
00:07:59,667 --> 00:08:01,000
Was it really worth it?

137
00:08:04,750 --> 00:08:08,417
I mean, looking at it,
it's not very big, is it?

138
00:08:10,625 --> 00:08:11,667
Sir Philip?

139
00:08:12,208 --> 00:08:13,042
Well,

140
00:08:13,333 --> 00:08:14,000
Um...

141
00:08:14,917 --> 00:08:20,167
It's an outstanding example
of late period Goya.

142
00:08:20,667 --> 00:08:21,750
It really is.

143
00:08:22,375 --> 00:08:23,208
Outstanding.

144
00:08:23,708 --> 00:08:25,542
An Interview With
THE RT. HON. RAB BUTLER M.P.

145
00:08:27,958 --> 00:08:29,125
This is chubby, love.

146
00:08:29,583 --> 00:08:30,542
A bit of mustard?

147
00:08:30,667 --> 00:08:33,125
You had servants in prison, did you?

148
00:08:33,292 --> 00:08:34,707
You know I don't like getting up.

149
00:08:35,207 --> 00:08:36,875
- I'll get it, Dad.
- No, you won't.

150
00:08:38,167 --> 00:08:39,000
Jackie.

151
00:08:41,832 --> 00:08:44,125
Not the Duke of bloody of Wellington.

152
00:08:47,500 --> 00:08:48,625
I sold one of my boats.

153
00:08:49,042 --> 00:08:50,708
So you didn't go at the night class?

154
00:08:51,182 --> 00:08:52,604
I thought you'd be happy for us.

155
00:08:52,750 --> 00:08:54,667
I 'd be happier
if you were getting yourself qualified.

156
00:08:54,750 --> 00:08:56,583
What's the armada down till then?

157
00:08:56,708 --> 00:08:57,667
Just the one left.

158
00:08:57,768 --> 00:08:59,333
<i>Are there any price, sir?</i>

159
00:08:59,792 --> 00:09:03,375
<i>We're not in the place of putting a price
on the Nations heritage.</i>

160
00:09:03,583 --> 00:09:04,583
They don't have to.

161
00:09:05,104 --> 00:09:08,042
It's the taxpayers, you and me, Jackie
that paid for that painting.

162
00:09:08,167 --> 00:09:10,292
Since when have you paid any tax?

163
00:09:10,833 --> 00:09:12,292
Welcome home, Kempton.

164
00:09:12,833 --> 00:09:14,583
Do you know
what's going off here, Jackie?

165
00:09:14,708 --> 00:09:16,625
Tuffs looking after their own,

166
00:09:16,708 --> 00:09:18,458
spending our hard-earned money,

167
00:09:18,583 --> 00:09:21,542
on a half baked portrait
by some Spanish drunk

168
00:09:21,757 --> 00:09:24,049
of a Duke who was a bastard to his men

169
00:09:24,135 --> 00:09:27,056
- and who voted against universal suffrage.
- Against what?

170
00:09:27,333 --> 00:09:28,167
The vote.

171
00:09:28,567 --> 00:09:30,625
The Duke of Wellington
didn't want you to have a say

172
00:09:30,625 --> 00:09:33,208
on how this country was run
when he was a Prime Minister.

173
00:09:33,292 --> 00:09:35,333
Think what they could have done
with all of that money?

174
00:09:35,362 --> 00:09:38,042
Give us thousands and thousands
of free TV licenses

175
00:09:38,042 --> 00:09:40,042
to war veterans and pensioners,
that's what.

176
00:09:40,250 --> 00:09:42,917
Are these speeches of yours
gonna put food on the table?

177
00:09:42,958 --> 00:09:45,917
You can stop that, Dolly.
I'm back on the taxies tomorrow.

178
00:09:45,960 --> 00:09:47,968
<i>No decision has yet been taken
by the British government,</i>

179
00:09:48,042 --> 00:09:50,417
<i>on the question of the common mass.</i>

180
00:09:50,542 --> 00:09:51,917
One who hopes,

181
00:09:52,000 --> 00:09:55,625
translated from what I couldn't say,
Esperanto, presumably.

182
00:09:55,833 --> 00:09:57,750
I'm not paying for conversation.

183
00:09:58,333 --> 00:10:00,000
I'll keep my trap shut then.

184
00:10:00,625 --> 00:10:04,625
In fact, he was a Polish eye doctor,
L.L. Zamenhof,

185
00:10:04,833 --> 00:10:07,333
his dream was to bring humanity together,

186
00:10:07,417 --> 00:10:09,792
by means of a universal language....

187
00:10:09,875 --> 00:10:11,792
Beecham Pills
Make life worth living

188
00:10:18,458 --> 00:10:19,583
Fuckin' hell.

189
00:10:20,622 --> 00:10:22,792
- What are you doing, kiddo?
- Putting a cabin on it.

190
00:10:23,917 --> 00:10:25,167
Boat building, eh?

191
00:10:26,042 --> 00:10:27,948
The Swan Hunter
will be shitting themselves.

192
00:10:30,583 --> 00:10:31,583
You're gonna live on it?

193
00:10:32,125 --> 00:10:33,039
Get out of the house?

194
00:10:33,125 --> 00:10:35,125
I sell them on,
as working boats.

195
00:10:37,917 --> 00:10:40,208
- What are you doing home?
- Keeping my head down.

196
00:10:41,042 --> 00:10:42,125
Are you in trouble?

197
00:10:43,750 --> 00:10:44,708
Not in Newcastle.

198
00:10:48,417 --> 00:10:49,667
Got a little job for you.

199
00:10:52,792 --> 00:10:54,000
I wanna keep my nose clean.

200
00:10:54,000 --> 00:10:55,458
- I'll source the car.
- No.

201
00:10:55,542 --> 00:10:57,500
- You have to drive it and get rid off it.
- No, I said no.

202
00:10:57,708 --> 00:10:59,625
- You did it before.
- Yeah, and I regret it.

203
00:11:00,500 --> 00:11:01,417
Well, think about it.

204
00:11:03,042 --> 00:11:04,292
A business opportunity.

205
00:11:06,833 --> 00:11:07,911
How's hostilities?

206
00:11:08,333 --> 00:11:10,625
He's writing away,
and mum's scrubbing the world clean.

207
00:11:13,875 --> 00:11:14,708
Bloody Marian.

208
00:11:16,667 --> 00:11:17,500
Aye.

209
00:11:17,833 --> 00:11:18,708
Bloody Marian.

210
00:11:26,208 --> 00:11:27,500
She normally sleeps through.

211
00:11:27,875 --> 00:11:30,208
You'll be fine, don't worry
she knows you, she likes you.

212
00:11:31,000 --> 00:11:32,375
Oh, Dorothy, would you mind?

213
00:11:33,042 --> 00:11:33,917
Sorry.

214
00:11:35,750 --> 00:11:37,458
I have always liked this dress.

215
00:11:37,792 --> 00:11:40,125
It's taffeta and I hate it,
it's so uncomfortable.

216
00:11:40,199 --> 00:11:43,384
Dolly, it's 7:30 to 8:00,
not 8:30 to 10:00.

217
00:11:43,448 --> 00:11:45,917
Oh God, Bennet.
Thank you, Dorothy.

218
00:11:49,542 --> 00:11:50,375
So,

219
00:11:50,667 --> 00:11:51,917
what is it tonight?

220
00:11:52,458 --> 00:11:53,750
Golf club gala.

221
00:11:54,542 --> 00:11:56,196
The only time
they let the ladies in.

222
00:11:56,322 --> 00:11:57,559
Don't you play there?

223
00:11:57,583 --> 00:11:58,958
Oh God, no.

224
00:11:59,375 --> 00:12:00,917
The end of civilization.

225
00:12:02,625 --> 00:12:04,292
So, is your...

226
00:12:04,708 --> 00:12:06,125
is your husband out?

227
00:12:08,167 --> 00:12:11,500
I mean, back. I saw the paper.

228
00:12:13,500 --> 00:12:15,792
- Do you want me to stop coming?
- No.

229
00:12:19,292 --> 00:12:20,708
No, it's...

230
00:12:21,375 --> 00:12:22,750
It's fine, Dorothy.

231
00:12:23,750 --> 00:12:25,208
We are very happy with you, really.

232
00:12:27,125 --> 00:12:30,125
I don't want to cause your husband
any embarrassment.

233
00:12:30,167 --> 00:12:32,042
No, we couldn't possibly have that.

234
00:12:32,625 --> 00:12:33,958
My husband's a counselor.

235
00:12:36,958 --> 00:12:38,700
It's a real conundrum there, isn't it?

236
00:12:39,292 --> 00:12:40,299
I mean...

237
00:12:40,417 --> 00:12:42,375
If you can't receive the BBC.

238
00:12:44,292 --> 00:12:45,542
Why should you pay the tax?

239
00:12:46,833 --> 00:12:47,833
I'll see you later.

240
00:12:52,250 --> 00:12:53,240
Any time this week?

241
00:12:53,340 --> 00:12:55,117
It doesn't take 5 minutes
to look like this.

242
00:12:55,217 --> 00:12:56,542
Let's just get going.

243
00:12:56,556 --> 00:12:58,028
- Where's my bag?
- On the **.

244
00:12:58,125 --> 00:13:00,030
- Have you got keys?
- I don't need keys.

245
00:13:02,375 --> 00:13:05,958
Susan, I'm not going down.

246
00:13:15,292 --> 00:13:17,417
HOW TO WRITE A PLAY

247
00:13:19,292 --> 00:13:20,875
You will like this one, love.

248
00:13:26,375 --> 00:13:27,667
Get yourself in there.

249
00:13:27,743 --> 00:13:29,035
Just take it easy, would you?

250
00:13:29,333 --> 00:13:32,292
The return of the prodigal son.
Don't give him any money.

251
00:13:32,292 --> 00:13:33,375
I haven't got any.

252
00:13:33,833 --> 00:13:35,167
Where have you two been?

253
00:13:35,195 --> 00:13:36,062
To the "Green Tree."

254
00:13:36,417 --> 00:13:37,042
Traitors.

255
00:13:37,250 --> 00:13:38,542
I know you're still barred from there.

256
00:13:38,667 --> 00:13:39,958
Pint in there isn't a pint.

257
00:13:40,042 --> 00:13:42,034
You could start a fight
in a ploughed field.

258
00:13:42,167 --> 00:13:44,375
They accused me
of nicking their toilet rolls.

259
00:13:44,375 --> 00:13:45,292
You were.

260
00:13:45,417 --> 00:13:48,042
I was, aye, but he had no evidence.
<i>Habeas corpus.</i>

261
00:13:48,125 --> 00:13:48,917
You're an idiot.

262
00:13:48,958 --> 00:13:49,833
Leave him alone, mum.

263
00:13:49,958 --> 00:13:51,667
Fish pie, Kenny? You look thin.

264
00:13:51,750 --> 00:13:53,333
What are you fussing around him for?

265
00:13:53,333 --> 00:13:55,208
For a change from fussing around you.

266
00:13:55,333 --> 00:13:58,208
Babycham for the lady.
Dad, yours.

267
00:13:58,583 --> 00:13:59,708
- Thank you.
- Bubble Brown.

268
00:13:59,750 --> 00:14:02,750
Be sure to use the coasters,
you're not in Leeds now.

269
00:14:02,875 --> 00:14:04,625
Yes, civilization here...

270
00:14:05,542 --> 00:14:07,917
- Put the news on, Dolly.
- We haven't got a license.

271
00:14:08,042 --> 00:14:10,458
- Who's side are you on?
- My side.

272
00:14:10,833 --> 00:14:12,750
I'm not turning that goggle box on.

273
00:14:13,167 --> 00:14:14,000
A toast,

274
00:14:14,625 --> 00:14:15,750
to the Buntons.

275
00:14:16,583 --> 00:14:17,583
Happy families.

276
00:14:17,792 --> 00:14:19,034
Happy families.

277
00:14:21,637 --> 00:14:23,393
Not that sodden painting again.

278
00:14:23,471 --> 00:14:25,733
National treasure
is the poor bloody foot soldiers

279
00:14:25,758 --> 00:14:28,245
that won his battles for him.
We should be celebrating.

280
00:14:28,322 --> 00:14:31,675
- Kick down every door.
- Quiet.

281
00:14:31,750 --> 00:14:34,333
- That's what doors are around for.
- Quiet!

282
00:14:34,375 --> 00:14:35,917
I hope you are proud of yourselves.

283
00:14:36,042 --> 00:14:38,174
They don't swallow up
what the establishment tells them.

284
00:14:38,217 --> 00:14:39,237
I'm proud of that.

285
00:14:40,208 --> 00:14:43,292
- Am I making a bed up for you?
- Aye, a couple of nights, mum.

286
00:14:43,596 --> 00:14:45,518
She'll miss you, your Dolly bird.

287
00:14:46,667 --> 00:14:49,000
Who are we talking about?
I heard that she's married. Pammy.

288
00:14:49,000 --> 00:14:50,000
She's separated, mum.

289
00:14:50,000 --> 00:14:51,625
If she is not divorced,
she is still a married woman.

290
00:14:51,667 --> 00:14:52,917
She was only married two months.

291
00:14:52,958 --> 00:14:54,917
Don't you go down that road, Jackie Bunton.

292
00:14:54,917 --> 00:14:56,208
I'm the devil incarnate, eh?

293
00:14:56,250 --> 00:14:58,417
We don't know anything
about your life in Leeds.

294
00:14:58,417 --> 00:14:59,417
Plenty of cash,

295
00:14:59,500 --> 00:15:00,375
never in work.

296
00:15:00,458 --> 00:15:02,417
I'm in construction, it's seasonal.

297
00:15:02,708 --> 00:15:04,667
You are always welcome here.
Back room's yours.

298
00:15:04,750 --> 00:15:07,125
I wouldn't be surprised to hear
she's in the family way.

299
00:15:07,208 --> 00:15:08,810
Fuck it! I've had enough.

300
00:15:08,910 --> 00:15:10,584
I'm not gonna have language
in this house!

301
00:15:10,684 --> 00:15:11,750
See you, dad, it's been lovely.

302
00:15:11,833 --> 00:15:13,411
No, I said you're welcome.

303
00:15:13,500 --> 00:15:15,371
I'm welcome, yeah?
I heard you.

304
00:15:15,471 --> 00:15:18,208
- I'm never welcome in this house.
- I don't want any swearing in here.

305
00:15:18,250 --> 00:15:19,542
You wonder why I take months away...

306
00:15:19,542 --> 00:15:21,708
I'll go and be United Nations.

307
00:15:21,792 --> 00:15:23,875
All I asked of you was just not to swear.

308
00:15:23,917 --> 00:15:25,583
The Portrait of the 1st Duke of Wellington

309
00:15:25,625 --> 00:15:27,667
set a record price for Goya

310
00:15:27,667 --> 00:15:33,096
<i>...it was knocked down to American

But I've got the testicles
of Henry VIII.

319
00:15:58,042 --> 00:16:01,417
You are 3.10 pound
short on yesterday, Bunton.

320
00:16:01,458 --> 00:16:03,542
Aye, an old fella, skint.

321
00:16:03,917 --> 00:16:07,034
- Why is he taking taxies then?
- He's a war veteran. Can't walk.

322
00:16:07,208 --> 00:16:09,667
I am running a taxi farm.

323
00:16:09,708 --> 00:16:11,000
Not a charity.

324
00:16:11,000 --> 00:16:13,958
- Dig it out my wages.
- I've had complaints.

325
00:16:14,167 --> 00:16:16,000
One, you talk too much,

326
00:16:16,208 --> 00:16:18,333
and two, it's utter bollocks.

327
00:16:18,708 --> 00:16:21,167
You are sacked with immediate effect.

328
00:16:21,458 --> 00:16:22,750
I haven't been paid.

329
00:16:22,958 --> 00:16:24,375
Sue me then.

330
00:16:24,667 --> 00:16:26,625
But fuck off first.

331
00:16:26,750 --> 00:16:27,833
Hello.

332
00:16:28,000 --> 00:16:29,167
Yes.

333
00:16:29,667 --> 00:16:33,042
I'll just take the address please,
thank you.

334
00:16:35,750 --> 00:16:38,125
Thank you very much,
will be there in a tick.

335
00:16:39,375 --> 00:16:41,500
There is nothing more powerful

336
00:16:41,708 --> 00:16:45,042
then when a community
discovers what it cares about.

337
00:16:46,417 --> 00:16:47,750
And when a man,

338
00:16:48,292 --> 00:16:51,708
accepts our essential interdependence.

339
00:16:51,712 --> 00:16:52,683
FREE TV FOR THE OAP

340
00:16:52,708 --> 00:16:54,500
In that moment, he...

341
00:16:55,042 --> 00:16:56,042
or she...

342
00:16:56,375 --> 00:16:57,750
becomes a woman.

343
00:17:00,667 --> 00:17:01,583
Or a man.

344
00:17:03,250 --> 00:17:05,041
As the case may be.

345
00:17:06,458 --> 00:17:07,541
How many have you got?

346
00:17:08,416 --> 00:17:10,958
The petition's only
one part of the campaign.

347
00:17:11,375 --> 00:17:13,250
- Three?
- We have just set off.

348
00:17:13,291 --> 00:17:16,166
Kempton Bunton?
That's not even a real name.

349
00:17:20,375 --> 00:17:22,458
Rome wasn't built in a day, Jackie.

350
00:17:23,041 --> 00:17:25,375
But, again,
I wasn't on that particular job.

351
00:17:25,458 --> 00:17:26,791
Oh, hello.

352
00:17:26,916 --> 00:17:29,167
Didn't know you were political,
Jackie Bunton.

353
00:17:29,875 --> 00:17:30,833
Yeah, it's my dad.

354
00:17:31,458 --> 00:17:32,417
His latest campaign.

355
00:17:33,375 --> 00:17:34,792
My nan would love a telly

356
00:17:34,833 --> 00:17:36,708
Why don't you sign
my petition then, love?

357
00:17:38,417 --> 00:17:39,833
I don't know about that.

358
00:17:43,208 --> 00:17:44,458
The hat suits you.

359
00:17:47,000 --> 00:17:48,958
I'd like to sign, Mr Bunton.

360
00:17:51,208 --> 00:17:52,917
Unless you have any objection.

361
00:17:53,333 --> 00:17:55,792
<i>Au contraire</i>, Mrs. Gowling, <i>au contraire</i>.

362
00:17:56,667 --> 00:17:57,500
Thank you.

363
00:17:58,125 --> 00:18:00,042
Now, where do I put my paw print?

364
00:18:00,333 --> 00:18:01,500
Just there please.

365
00:18:02,792 --> 00:18:07,000
SEEDS

366
00:18:12,542 --> 00:18:16,708
FREE TV FOR THE OAP

367
00:18:16,750 --> 00:18:19,542
If Jackie goes to the bad
I'm holding you responsible.

368
00:18:19,542 --> 00:18:21,625
It will be the straw, I promise you.

369
00:18:22,208 --> 00:18:25,250
You can do your petitions,
write your plays in prison.

370
00:18:25,292 --> 00:18:27,750
They will do your cooking
and your washing for you and all.

371
00:18:27,750 --> 00:18:28,708
But I've had enough,

372
00:18:28,833 --> 00:18:30,000
Had it up to here.

373
00:18:37,292 --> 00:18:38,208
A peace offering.

374
00:18:52,625 --> 00:18:54,708
- Good dunkers, them ginger--
- What do you want?

375
00:18:56,417 --> 00:18:57,208
A pact.

376
00:18:59,500 --> 00:19:01,333
Two days in London.

377
00:19:02,167 --> 00:19:04,260
Give me two days,
then I'll be back for good,

378
00:19:04,284 --> 00:19:05,708
get a job, keep my head down.

379
00:19:06,333 --> 00:19:08,500
I didn't come down in the
last shower, you know.

380
00:19:08,583 --> 00:19:10,000
I promise, two days.

381
00:19:11,750 --> 00:19:14,042
To change anything,
you have to go to Parliament.

382
00:19:14,167 --> 00:19:15,875
You are wasting your life.

383
00:19:16,042 --> 00:19:17,583
How do you eat an elephant?

384
00:19:18,292 --> 00:19:19,500
Who eats elephants?

385
00:19:19,542 --> 00:19:21,458
One bite at a time.

386
00:19:21,667 --> 00:19:22,833
Stop this.

387
00:19:24,375 --> 00:19:26,917
Please, Kempton, please, love, please.

388
00:19:29,667 --> 00:19:30,625
I'm beggin' you,

389
00:19:31,583 --> 00:19:33,333
stop all your agitations.

390
00:19:33,333 --> 00:19:34,833
Two days, that's all.

391
00:19:34,875 --> 00:19:37,375
If I hit a brick wall down there,
that would be the end of it.

392
00:19:38,292 --> 00:19:39,875
Two days, that's all I need

393
00:19:39,958 --> 00:19:42,417
then I swear to God
it'll be the last of it.

394
00:19:42,542 --> 00:19:44,875
The plays, the politics, the Lott.

395
00:19:46,458 --> 00:19:47,583
Two days.

396
00:19:49,833 --> 00:19:50,917
One last chance.

397

Do you have an appointment?

403
00:20:18,792 --> 00:20:20,125
He will want to see me.

404
00:20:20,917 --> 00:20:21,750
I'm sorry.

405
00:20:22,042 --> 00:20:24,125
I sent him my trilogy of plays,

406
00:20:24,125 --> 00:20:27,417
each one tackling a different aspect
of social injustice.

407
00:20:27,667 --> 00:20:28,625
He is not here.

408
00:20:29,042 --> 00:20:29,917
Not here?

409
00:20:30,167 --> 00:20:31,958
He's gone to Granada.

410
00:20:32,292 --> 00:20:33,583
Granada TV?

411
00:20:33,792 --> 00:20:36,292
No, Granada in Spain.

412
00:20:37,417 --> 00:20:38,333
I could wait.

413
00:20:40,667 --> 00:20:41,833
Right.

The Daily Telegraph,

Daily Express.

419
00:21:03,000 --> 00:21:05,375
I need to speak to the boss, love.
It's urgent.

420
00:21:05,458 --> 00:21:06,417
He's over there.

421
00:21:07,458 --> 00:21:09,667
- Sir, I have a story.
Is that right?

422
00:21:09,708 --> 00:21:11,333
- It's a campaign...
- I don't do campaigns.

423
00:21:11,583 --> 00:21:14,208
- It's about social injustice.
- I don't do social injustice.

424
00:21:14,208 --> 00:21:15,875
- Shall I buy you..
- I don't do lunch.

425
00:21:18,792 --> 00:21:19,708
Another time.

426
00:21:25,792 --> 00:21:29,583
Friends, members and citizens of
this great Mother of Parliament...

427
00:21:30,208 --> 00:21:31,917
Members, representatives...

428
00:21:44,500 --> 00:21:45,333
Friends...

429
00:21:46,542 --> 00:21:48,042
Fellow citizens...

430
00:21:48,792 --> 00:21:52,042
Elected representatives
of this noble house.

431
00:21:52,250 --> 00:21:53,750
Lend me your ears.

432
00:21:53,958 --> 00:21:54,833
Let's just move on quietly, sir.

433
00:21:54,833 --> 00:21:59,292
I come not to bring a protest,
but to demand this government

434
00:21:59,333 --> 00:22:00,333
Alright.

435
00:22:40,958 --> 00:22:45,167
Line up to meet the Duke.

436
00:23:18,917 --> 00:23:20,792
The National Gallery.

437
00:24:34,625 --> 00:24:38,414
<i>The portrait was missing when the
first shift of attendants reported to duty</i>

438
00:24:38,460 --> 00:24:39,917
<i>there at seven this morning.</i>

439
00:24:40,208 --> 00:24:41,875
<i>When the gallery closed last night,</i>

440
00:24:41,917 --> 00:24:43,625
<i>The Goya was still in its usual place.</i>

441
00:24:43,667 --> 00:24:45,917
<i>The National Gallery is appealing to anybody
who was here yesterday</i>

442
00:24:45,958 --> 00:24:49,417
<i>and who saw anything
or anybody they think was suspicious</i>

443
00:24:49,500 --> 00:24:50,792
<i>to get in touch with the police.</i>

444
00:24:50,792 --> 00:24:52,333
Will it be out of the country, Sir?

445
00:24:52,458 --> 00:24:56,792
Well, looking at the degree of planning
and expertise involved

446
00:24:56,792 --> 00:24:59,833
we are convinced that the Goya
has been stolen to order

447
00:25:00,017 --> 00:25:05,392
by a well-funded, highly professional
international criminal gang.

448
00:25:06,042 --> 00:25:07,375
Any suspects yet?

449
00:25:07,375 --> 00:25:09,167
Not very good, is it?

450
00:25:12,042 --> 00:25:13,167
What about the police?

451
00:25:13,292 --> 00:25:15,932
No one's looking for the Duke of Wellington
in Benwell.

452
00:25:16,792 --> 00:25:17,583
- Christ!
- Christ!

453
00:25:17,708 --> 00:25:19,125
Don't touch it!

454
00:25:19,917 --> 00:25:21,167
Jesus Christ!

455
00:25:22,208 --> 00:25:24,375
Christ is the man
we need right now.

456
00:25:25,042 --> 00:25:26,792
- How come?
- Carpenter.

457
00:25:27,417 --> 00:25:29,958
Someone who knows how to put
a false back on that wardrobe.

458
00:25:30,875 --> 00:25:32,958
- I can do that.
- Get on with it then.

459
00:25:44,750 --> 00:25:46,667
The next step, communication.

460
00:25:46,749 --> 00:25:48,034
Cut letters out of the paper?

461
00:25:48,208 --> 00:25:50,625
No, do that, and you'd be telling them
what paper you read,

462
00:25:50,658 --> 00:25:51,824
what glue you've got in the house,

463
00:25:51,875 --> 00:25:53,799
whether you use right-
or left-handed scissors.

464
00:25:53,917 --> 00:25:56,042
That's three cords,
and that's when they've got you.

465
00:25:56,292 --> 00:25:58,750
That's why this letter cannot be posted
to Newcastle.

466
00:25:59,042 --> 00:26:01,250
Query note that I have the Goya.

467
00:26:01,583 --> 00:26:05,958
The act is an attempt to pick the pockets
of those who love art more than charity.

468
00:26:06,208 --> 00:26:08,500
A bit of "Robin Hood". Like that?

469
00:26:08,958 --> 00:26:10,208
- Mum.
- Christ!

470
00:26:15,042 --> 00:26:17,708
- How was Aunt Betty?
- Why are you wearing rubber gloves?

471
00:26:17,875 --> 00:26:18,750
Varnish.

472
00:26:19,042 --> 00:26:19,833
Been on the boat.

473
00:26:20,208 --> 00:26:21,000
Hello, pet.

474
00:26:21,167 --> 00:26:22,417
Oh, you're back.

475
00:26:22,625 --> 00:26:24,458
Didn't bring down the government then?

476
00:26:24,625 --> 00:26:28,417
I exercised my democratic right,
now it's up to them.

477
00:26:28,417 --> 00:26:30,208
What matters is, I'm back.

478
00:26:30,208 --> 00:26:32,417
So, you'll be going
to the labor exchange?

479
00:26:32,417 --> 00:26:33,750
Tomorrow, first thing.

480
00:26:33,833 --> 00:26:34,833
Shall I put the kettle, love?

481
00:26:34,917 --> 00:26:37,167
If you think it will go with your outfit.

482
00:26:38,000 --> 00:26:38,792
So...

483
00:26:39,125 --> 00:26:41,458
Gonna keep your name
out of the papers?

484
00:26:41,708 --> 00:26:42,833
Aye, well...

485
00:26:42,917 --> 00:26:46,417
There's no reason for me to be
of any interest to the press, ever again.

486
00:26:46,500 --> 00:26:48,167
Why are you wearing rubber gloves?

487
00:26:49,917 --> 00:26:51,208
That blocked drain.

488
00:26:51,333 --> 00:26:53,250
We don't have a blocked drain.

489
00:26:53,500 --> 00:26:54,500
Next doors'.

490
00:26:55,417 --> 00:26:57,167
We don't talk to next door.

491
00:26:57,917 --> 00:26:59,333
You've gotta build bridges.

492
00:27:05,792 --> 00:27:07,792
<i>Paris, Vienna, and London.</i>

493
00:27:07,875 --> 00:27:09,458
- I'm off.
- Where to?

494
00:27:10,167 --> 00:27:11,167
Rainbow Rooms.

495
00:27:11,917 --> 00:27:14,208
Why in God's name
would you wanna go to a club

496
00:27:14,333 --> 00:27:16,208
with music and drinking and girls,

497
00:27:16,333 --> 00:27:19,042
when you could stop
and watch telly with me and your mum.

498
00:27:19,125 --> 00:27:20,917
Don't drink too much
if you are on that bike.

499
00:27:20,942 --> 00:27:23,585
- I'll be careful, see you later, dad.
- And wear your helmet.

500
00:27:23,640 --> 00:27:27,333
<i>We show our great appreciation
to the Government of Australia,</i>

501
00:27:30,042 --> 00:27:30,875
Now then.

502
00:27:31,542 --> 00:27:33,292
Oh no, what have I done?

503
00:27:33,333 --> 00:27:34,458
Kempton Bunton.

504
00:27:34,708 --> 00:27:36,458
I want you to swear to me,

505
00:27:36,833 --> 00:27:39,375
that you have given up
all your nonsense.

506
00:27:39,417 --> 00:27:40,500
I swear.

507
00:27:41,125 --> 00:27:42,167
I swear.

508
00:27:42,208 --> 00:27:43,042
Promise me.

509
00:27:43,167 --> 00:27:44,000
Dolly, love,

510
00:27:44,542 --> 00:27:45,583
I've learned my lesson.

511
00:27:45,583 --> 00:27:46,875
No more secrets.

512
00:27:46,917 --> 00:27:50,750
Nothing, <i>haria nada</i>.
I promise.

513
00:27:51,750 --> 00:27:55,708
<i>Meanwhile the hunt for the
missing Goya portrait continues.</i>

514
00:27:56,042 --> 00:27:58,971
<i>I feel I can trace out the thief
pretty well.</i>

515
00:27:59,042 --> 00:28:00,958
<i>He's most likely highly physically tuned.</i>

516
00:28:01,042 --> 00:28:03,583
<i>Almost certainly
a trained "commando",</i>

517
00:28:03,667 --> 00:28:05,333
<i>or ex Special Forces.</i>

518
00:28:05,333 --> 00:28:07,000
<i>And in cases like this</i>

519
00:28:07,000 --> 00:28:07,833
You alright?

520
00:28:08,375 --> 00:28:10,375
<i>do you expect the criminals
to eventually make contact?</i>

521
00:28:10,500 --> 00:28:11,542
It's the biscuit.

522
00:28:11,625 --> 00:28:14,667
<i>We are expecting some communication
from the thieves.</i>

523
00:28:14,792 --> 00:28:16,875
<i>When it comes, we will respond.</i>

524
00:28:20,500 --> 00:28:22,417
Do you remember Fat Stan?

525
00:28:23,292 --> 00:28:25,042
- Track marshal at the docks.
- What?

526
00:28:25,750 --> 00:28:27,042
Well, his brother in law

527
00:28:27,167 --> 00:28:29,833
Geert, nice fella, dutch.

528
00:28:30,208 --> 00:28:34,042
He's the foreman at this
plastics injection molding plant.

529
00:28:34,458 --> 00:28:36,958
And he said to Fat Stan
that there is a job going.

530
00:28:37,000 --> 00:28:38,333
But it's ten o'clock at night.

531
00:28:39,375 --> 00:28:40,250
He is on night.

532
00:28:40,708 --> 00:28:42,375
Who? Geert or Stan?

533
00:28:42,833 --> 00:28:43,583
Stan.

534
00:28:43,792 --> 00:28:44,792
I mean Geert.

535
00:28:45,917 --> 00:28:47,208
He is night-shift foreman.

536
00:28:48,333 --> 00:28:49,167
At night.

537
00:28:51,924 --> 00:28:54,674
I wouldn't expect I'll be long
but don't wait up.

538
00:28:59,333 --> 00:29:00,167
Ta da.

539
00:29:01,331 --> 00:29:04,289
<i>The National Gallery announced</i>

540
00:29:04,458 --> 00:29:07,333
<i>a 5000 pound reward for
anyone who provides any information.</i>

541
00:29:07,542 --> 00:29:12,375
FIRESTONE TYRE SERVICE
ACE SERVICE STATION

542
00:29:17,333 --> 00:29:19,500
- How far are you going?
- Morecambe.

543
00:29:19,667 --> 00:29:21,750
Morecambe will be just champion.

544
00:29:27,333 --> 00:29:29,125
Would you like a wine gum?

545
00:31:07,792 --> 00:31:10,208
THE GIRL ON THE BICYCLE

546
00:31:24,333 --> 00:31:25,167
What are you doing?

547
00:31:28,042 --> 00:31:29,208
Have you read this one?

548
00:31:31,000 --> 00:31:33,583
What's it called?
The girl on the bicycle.

549
00:31:35,375 --> 00:31:36,042
No.

550
00:31:36,875 --> 00:31:39,417
- I don't think you should either.
- So, you have read it.

551
00:31:40,125 --> 00:31:41,333
He's told me what's it's about.

552
00:31:41,333 --> 00:31:43,042
Making money out of our grief.

553
00:31:43,042 --> 00:31:44,667
- It's just writing.
- Well, it's wrong.

554
00:31:45,208 --> 00:31:46,625
What else can he do?

555
00:31:47,000 --> 00:31:49,417
- You will never talk about it.
- What's there to talk about?

556
00:31:49,750 --> 00:31:50,708
It's done, isn't it?

557
00:31:53,167 --> 00:31:54,000
She's dead.

558
00:32:02,843 --> 00:32:03,833
I'm back.

559
00:32:11,500 --> 00:32:12,583
Where did you find that?

560
00:32:13,208 --> 00:32:15,042
In the wardrobe in the back room.

561
00:32:15,792 --> 00:32:17,000
What were you doing in there?

562
00:32:17,500 --> 00:32:18,458
I live here.

563
00:32:31,750 --> 00:32:34,792
They've got that West Side Story out
on the ABC Percy Street.

564
00:32:34,792 --> 00:32:35,792
You fancy, tomorrow?

565
00:32:35,833 --> 00:32:38,708
We can't afford to waste money
going to the pictures.

566
00:32:50,833 --> 00:32:54,708
It's "Romeo and Juliet,"
but with singing and dancing.

567
00:32:54,792 --> 00:32:57,333
And it's set in New York,
not Stratford-upon-Avon.

568
00:33:02,375 --> 00:33:03,500
How far have you got?

569
00:33:03,708 --> 00:33:04,542
Far enough.

570
00:33:04,833 --> 00:33:05,750
It's not Marian.

571
00:33:05,792 --> 00:33:08,208
There is a girl
who dies in a bicycle crash.

572
00:33:08,208 --> 00:33:10,375
That girl's knocked off her bike
by a bus in town.

573
00:33:10,417 --> 00:33:13,208
Our Marian came off her bike
going downhill in the country.

574
00:33:13,208 --> 00:33:14,833
- Who's read this?
Nobody, I should...

575
00:33:14,833 --> 00:33:16,500
thinking of only sending one copy out.

576
00:33:17,583 --> 00:33:18,417
Who to?

577
00:33:19,208 --> 00:33:20,042
Telly.

578
00:33:22,708 --> 00:33:24,875
So, the world and his wives gonna know.

579
00:33:25,292 --> 00:33:28,417
- You've never let me talk about it.
- Grief is private.

580
00:33:28,458 --> 00:33:31,833
I bought her that bike, if I got her
anything else she'd still be alive.

581
00:33:31,917 --> 00:33:33,167
Well, she isn't.

582
00:34:30,500 --> 00:34:31,833
He is not a writer.

583
00:34:32,125 --> 00:34:34,208
He has potentials, but he can't write.

584
00:34:34,792 --> 00:34:36,667
- Where was it posted?
- Morecambe.

585
00:34:37,375 --> 00:34:38,833
He is not an educated man.

586
00:34:39,375 --> 00:34:41,125
Could it be... Italian?

587
00:34:41,292 --> 00:34:42,583
No, British.

588
00:34:42,625 --> 00:34:44,792
Northern, this comma here
tells us a lot.

589
00:34:44,875 --> 00:34:45,708
What do you mean?

590
00:34:46,533 --> 00:34:47,542
It's gratuitous.

591
00:34:48,010 --> 00:34:50,667
It evidents his poor education,
he's an autodidactic.

592
00:34:50,750 --> 00:34:51,833
A car mechanic?

593
00:34:52,583 --> 00:34:55,458
He's self taught over a lifetime.

594
00:34:55,667 --> 00:34:57,417
I'd put him somewhere in his late fifties.

595
00:34:57,542 --> 00:35:00,667
So, what is his mental state then?

596
00:35:01,792 --> 00:35:05,875
The act is an attempt to pick the pockets
of those who love art more than charity.

597
00:35:06,667 --> 00:35:08,958
He is an fantasist, who believes
he's an idealist.

598
00:35:09,375 --> 00:35:10,625
A kind of Don Quixote.

599
00:35:11,333 --> 00:35:13,375
The windmill fella.

600
00:35:14,417 --> 00:35:16,042
He'll be active in his community.

601
00:35:16,167 --> 00:35:17,833
Known for his local campaigns.

602
00:35:17,932 --> 00:35:20,292
Parking, litter, pub hours,
that sort of thing.

603
00:35:20,458 --> 00:35:22,833
Thank you, it was very helpful.

604
00:35:24,708 --> 00:35:25,625
My pleasure.

605
00:35:28,208 --> 00:35:29,375
Can someone show me out?

606
00:35:29,458 --> 00:35:32,575
I wouldn't dare, you'd be telling
everybody what I ate for breakfast.

607
00:35:39,000 --> 00:35:39,958
Nice ass.

608
00:35:40,208 --> 00:35:41,583
You are a married man, Reg.

609
00:35:41,625 --> 00:35:43,625
I can look at the menu
as long as I eat at home.

610
00:35:43,667 --> 00:35:45,542
So this fella got the painting, yeah?

611
00:35:45,583 --> 00:35:48,542
Time wasting bastard,
he's just after the reward.

612
00:35:48,958 --> 00:35:51,167
The Italians still favourite, then?

613
00:35:51,208 --> 00:35:52,583
It's where the clever money is.

614
00:36:03,250 --> 00:36:04,417
My first day.

615
00:36:05,458 --> 00:36:06,375
Might be your last.

616
00:36:15,292 --> 00:36:17,583
Watch these buns man, they're fast.

617
00:36:17,667 --> 00:36:19,625
Get three like bricks, yeah?

618
00:36:25,542 --> 00:36:28,333
In the future
they'll have robots doing this.

619
00:36:28,667 --> 00:36:29,875
Yeah, I can't wait.

620
00:36:30,125 --> 00:36:32,792
The likes of me and you,
will spend our day

621
00:36:32,917 --> 00:36:36,583
developing our mind
for the literature and orchestra concerts.

622
00:36:36,583 --> 00:36:38,000
Please, just keep working.

623
00:36:39,500 --> 00:36:41,292
Come on, mind your boomers.

624
00:36:41,583 --> 00:36:43,208
It's his first day, Mr. Walker.

625
00:36:43,333 --> 00:36:44,750
Well, you can watch it now.

626
00:36:44,833 --> 00:36:47,417
I'm still getting used to your
lot touching our white loafs, eh?

627
00:36:48,167 --> 00:36:49,000
Yes, sir.

628
00:36:49,792 --> 00:36:50,625
Come on.

629
00:37:10,333 --> 00:37:12,167
Nothing.

630
00:37:13,667 --> 00:37:15,375
Do you want them papers, Mister?

631
00:37:16,000 --> 00:37:17,542
No, you have 'em, bonnie lad.

632
00:37:17,937 --> 00:37:21,958
Good firelighters, but you wouldn't find
any of them speaking truth.

633
00:37:23,503 --> 00:37:25,833
What are you playing, lads? Tip and run?

634
00:37:26,042 --> 00:37:28,250
- Can I have a ball?
- No. You're alright.

635
00:37:28,917 --> 00:37:31,208
Le Gallais & Sons
"Duke of Wellington"

636
00:37:46,375 --> 00:37:47,333
Christ.

637
00:38:03,292 --> 00:38:07,208
You are Kempton Bunton
and I claim my five thousand pound reward.

638
00:38:07,500 --> 00:38:09,667
Jack, bugger, I nearly shit myself.

639
00:38:10,500 --> 00:38:11,667
Why did you open it up for?

640
00:38:12,042 --> 00:38:14,042
No reaction to my first communications,

641
00:38:14,042 --> 00:38:15,417
so, I took the ticket off the back.

642
00:38:15,583 --> 00:38:17,208
Proof positive that I've got it.

643
00:38:17,208 --> 00:38:20,042
This to the working man's paper,
the Daily Mirror.

644
00:38:21,583 --> 00:38:24,000
- Mum!
- Quick! Sort this lot out.

645
00:38:24,000 --> 00:38:24,833

♪ And round about 11

647
00:38:38,504 --> 00:38:41,042

- Stop it, you daft brush.

648
00:38:41,125 --> 00:38:42,333
Anyhow, it's half three.

649
00:38:42,375 --> 00:38:44,167
You are a beautiful dancer.

650
00:38:44,375 --> 00:38:45,792
Graceful, fluid.

I always said
we should have entered that competition.

654
00:38:51,983 --> 00:38:53,067
We'd never have won.

655
00:38:53,167 --> 00:38:54,292
Swept the board.

656
00:38:55,542 --> 00:38:58,208

Hollisons new star baker.

00:38:58,333 --> 00:39:00,042

I thought it was plastics.

00:39:00,125 --> 00:39:00,833
No.

659
00:39:00,958 --> 00:39:03,458

Number two oven man.

660
00:39:03,458 --> 00:39:05,000

So, will it be regular?

662
00:39:06,042 --> 00:39:08,875
I am sticking to it
like a swan to water.

663
00:39:09,500 --> 00:39:10,875
And a free loaf every day.

664
00:39:12,042 --> 00:39:14,417

- Pork pie?

665
00:39:14,417 --> 00:39:16,583
- Slightly damaged.

Light and airy, for ladies

One day, aye.

We'll gonna be millionaires.

690
00:40:35,500 --> 00:40:36,833
That's what I wanna do.

691
00:40:38,750 --> 00:40:40,500

Nah.

Mum wants me to wear a shirt & tie.

It's bad enough we have to get up.

703

But you...

704
00:41:34,208 --> 00:41:35,292
Don't mind.

705
00:41:35,958 --> 00:41:37,542

00:41:40,208 --> 00:41:41,500
Eat up, you're late.

708
00:41:41,950 --> 00:41:45,000
That's the shipping ticket
that was attached to the back of the Goya.

709
00:41:45,042 --> 00:41:47,042
And he sent it to...

710
00:41:47,174 --> 00:41:48,750
The Daily Mirror, Home Secretary.

711
00:41:48,958 --> 00:41:50,333
So an arrest is imminent?

712
00:41:50,542 --> 00:41:52,875
Not as such.

713
00:41:53,875 --> 00:41:56,042
But we know where this note was posted?

714
00:41:56,167 --> 00:41:57,375
Central Birmingham.

715
00:41:57,750 --> 00:41:59,167
The Italians?

716
00:42:00,667 --> 00:42:04,208
We are re-evaluating
the aspect of the inquiry, sir.

717
00:42:04,333 --> 00:42:07,875
But we can pinpoint precisely
the whereabouts of this person.

718
00:42:08,667 --> 00:42:12,417
Also we're pretty sure he resides
between Morecambe and Birmingham and he's

719
00:42:12,625 --> 00:42:15,417
traveled in that area
at some time for work.

720
00:42:15,708 --> 00:42:18,875
So, he could be one of about
23 million people?

721
00:42:19,917 --> 00:42:22,458
If he's still in the area, yes, sir.

722
00:42:24,333 --> 00:42:28,167
The Duke is safe, his temperature cared for,
his future uncertain.

723
00:42:28,325 --> 00:42:31,042
We ask that some known conformist
type of person,

724
00:42:31,042 --> 00:42:33,125
with the the sportitude of a Billy Butlin,

725
00:42:33,125 --> 00:42:35,792
and the fearless fortitude 
of a Montgomery--

726
00:42:35,875 --> 00:42:38,500
Sportitude, fortitude.
The man's a bloody poet.

727
00:42:38,750 --> 00:42:41,375
Perhaps we can lock
W. H. Auden up at last.

728
00:42:41,417 --> 00:42:43,708
What's he actually asking for?

729
00:42:47,042 --> 00:42:50,583
One hundred and forty thousand pounds,
Home Secretary.

730
00:42:50,750 --> 00:42:52,958
Good grief, for what?

731
00:42:53,042 --> 00:42:53,917
For charity.

732
00:42:54,042 --> 00:42:55,625
As yet, unspecified.

733
00:42:55,833 --> 00:42:57,167
Clearly a lunatic.

734
00:42:57,542 --> 00:42:59,458
We will, of course, follow any credible...

735
00:42:59,458 --> 00:43:00,625
Now be quiet, MacPherson.

736
00:43:00,708 --> 00:43:01,333
Sir.

737
00:43:01,708 --> 00:43:04,194
Gentlemen, I am fully
prepared for martyrdom

738
00:43:04,218 --> 00:43:06,250
but I would rather like it delayed.

739
00:43:06,333 --> 00:43:08,958
And you chaps I believe
need to keep your jobs.

740
00:43:09,000 --> 00:43:11,167
So we'll meet again in 48 hours

741
00:43:11,167 --> 00:43:13,500
when you will tell me
of the very significant progress

742
00:43:13,500 --> 00:43:17,417
you have made in solving
this extremely serious crime.

743
00:43:17,750 --> 00:43:18,792
Yes, Home Secretary.

744
00:43:23,708 --> 00:43:26,042
BBC,
Kempton Bunton

745
00:43:37,750 --> 00:43:38,583
I'm back.

746
00:43:40,625 --> 00:43:42,542
Where have you been?

747
00:43:43,875 --> 00:43:45,375
Large white slice.

748
00:43:45,917 --> 00:43:47,000
Slightly damaged.

749
00:43:51,375 --> 00:43:52,750
This came for you.

750
00:43:56,625 --> 00:43:58,500
BBC, the play.

751
00:43:59,125 --> 00:44:01,583
The one that's not about the accident.

752
00:44:01,625 --> 00:44:03,625
They really want me
to go down to London,

753
00:44:04,500 --> 00:44:06,208
supervise the production.

754
00:44:09,500 --> 00:44:11,708
Thank you for giving the Drama Department

755
00:44:11,792 --> 00:44:15,000
the opportunity of reading
your intriguing play.

756
00:44:15,875 --> 00:44:19,492
Unfortunately, it is difficult
to find an audience

757
00:44:19,516 --> 00:44:21,208
for plays about grief.

758
00:44:25,500 --> 00:44:29,167
Whoever they get to replace, can't be
writers. That's all I can say.

759
00:44:32,458 --> 00:44:33,458
Whoever they are...

760
00:44:34,833 --> 00:44:36,792
Or maybe it's best
they've said no.

761
00:44:42,583 --> 00:44:43,417
Aye.

762
00:44:49,917 --> 00:44:50,750
What's for tea?

763
00:44:51,583 --> 00:44:52,500
Sausage and mash.

764
00:44:52,958 --> 00:44:53,792
Done.

765
00:44:54,750 --> 00:44:56,000
Pair of kings.

766
00:44:57,500 --> 00:44:58,375
**

767
00:45:00,132 --> 00:45:02,292
**

768
00:45:04,833 --> 00:45:06,667
- Three aces.
- What? No!

769
00:45:07,583 --> 00:45:09,208
There he is.

770
00:45:09,917 --> 00:45:12,292
I might have known, Mr. Akram.

771
00:45:12,623 --> 00:45:14,632
- You're still on parking time, are you?
- No, sir.

772
00:45:14,738 --> 00:45:16,307
- Had your 10 minutes.
- Sorry, sir.

773
00:45:16,333 --> 00:45:17,667
Let him finish the game.

774
00:45:18,184 --> 00:45:18,937
What?

775
00:45:19,042 --> 00:45:20,958
Me and Javid broke at the same time.

776
00:45:21,000 --> 00:45:22,583
Kempton, please, it doesn't matter.

777
00:45:22,608 --> 00:45:24,321
It does matter,
we get a 15 minute break

778
00:45:24,346 --> 00:45:25,612
and we've only had nine minutes of it.

779
00:45:25,667 --> 00:45:27,721
You don't understand,
it's different for me...

780
00:45:27,776 --> 00:45:29,917
Are you accusing me
of racialist discrimination?

781
00:45:30,000 --> 00:45:32,167
- No, no, no.
- Hey.

782
00:45:32,292 --> 00:45:33,500
I like Pakis, mate.

783
00:45:33,875 --> 00:45:35,542
I mean, if it wasn't for your lot,

784
00:45:35,792 --> 00:45:38,958
I wouldn't be able to get a pint of milk
on a Christmas morning, eh?

785
00:45:40,588 --> 00:45:42,375
I'm going back up now, sir.

786
00:45:43,125 --> 00:45:44,458
Sit down, Bunton.

787
00:45:45,667 --> 00:45:46,667
You can finish your game.

788
00:45:47,292 --> 00:45:51,125
I will not let anyone walk through my mind
with their dirty feet.

789
00:45:51,417 --> 00:45:52,625
Mahatma Gandhi.

790
00:45:56,917 --> 00:45:57,750
Well.

791
00:45:58,583 --> 00:46:00,458
That is brilliant, that is.

792
00:46:01,708 --> 00:46:02,917
I tell you what, Bunton.

793
00:46:03,542 --> 00:46:04,375
Get your card,

794
00:46:04,792 --> 00:46:06,208
clock off and fuck off.

795
00:46:07,000 --> 00:46:08,958
You can have as long a break
as you want, man.

796
00:46:12,750 --> 00:46:17,042
HEYBURYS BAKER & CONFECTIONER

797
00:46:20,750 --> 00:46:22,792
Can I have one of them pork pies, please?

798
00:46:22,958 --> 00:46:24,625
Yeah, one pork-pie, anything else?

799
00:46:24,875 --> 00:46:25,833
No, thank you.

800
00:46:27,667 --> 00:46:30,250
Can you just damage it a bit, please?

801
00:46:31,042 --> 00:46:31,792
Damage it?

802
00:46:31,833 --> 00:46:33,958
Just chip a bit of pastry of the side.

803
00:46:36,208 --> 00:46:37,875
-I can.
-Thank you.

804
00:47:03,792 --> 00:47:04,750
Where were you?

805
00:47:05,708 --> 00:47:06,917
What's your answer to that then?

806
00:47:12,583 --> 00:47:13,625
What are you doing here?

807
00:47:13,833 --> 00:47:15,458
Stopping over for a couple of night, dad.

808
00:47:15,917 --> 00:47:16,750
This is Pammy.

809
00:47:17,125 --> 00:47:18,875
Hiya, Mr. Bunton.

810
00:47:19,292 --> 00:47:20,125
What do you want?

811
00:47:20,375 --> 00:47:21,625
Talking to your lad.

812
00:47:22,375 --> 00:47:23,375
In a bedroom?

813
00:47:23,542 --> 00:47:25,208
Well, when we knocked on the front door,

814
00:47:25,458 --> 00:47:28,125
Pamela here didn't seem to think
your Kenny was at home.

815
00:47:28,333 --> 00:47:29,333
Would you believe it?

816
00:47:29,542 --> 00:47:30,667
We found him up here.

817
00:47:30,667 --> 00:47:33,292
-Shall we all go downstairs?
-Well... Alright.

818
00:47:34,375 --> 00:47:37,583
Kenny should've given evidence yesterday
at Leeds Crown Court

819
00:47:37,708 --> 00:47:38,833
but he did a runner.

820
00:47:39,542 --> 00:47:41,417
-What've you done, Kenneth?
-Me? Nothing.

821
00:47:42,042 --> 00:47:44,000
They want me to grass up a pal of mine.

822
00:47:44,708 --> 00:47:46,333
You need a witness summons then.

823
00:47:46,333 --> 00:47:49,000
Has everyone in this family
got a law degree?

824
00:47:49,000 --> 00:47:52,833
I'm not legally qualified as such,
I'm more a talented amateur.

825
00:47:53,333 --> 00:47:54,750
One witness summons.

826
00:47:55,167 --> 00:47:56,458
Leeds Crown Court.

827
00:47:56,917 --> 00:47:57,917
Thursday.

828
00:47:58,542 --> 00:47:59,375
Thank you.

829
00:48:00,042 --> 00:48:01,792
We'll see ourselves out.

830
00:48:02,292 --> 00:48:03,500
Ta-ra, boys.

831
00:48:04,542 --> 00:48:05,375
Ta-ra.

832
00:48:09,167 --> 00:48:10,417
You can't stay in this room.

833
00:48:10,667 --> 00:48:11,750
I'm writing here.

834
00:48:12,667 --> 00:48:13,917
But mum said it'll be alright.

835
00:48:14,417 --> 00:48:15,250
Where is she?

836
00:48:15,542 --> 00:48:16,958
Shops, I gave her some money.

837
00:48:17,625 --> 00:48:19,398
Not enough dinner now over here?

838
00:48:20,708 --> 00:48:23,292
"Dinner" is what they have down south.
Up here it's tea.

839
00:48:24,917 --> 00:48:26,625
I'm against hanging on principle,

840
00:48:26,850 --> 00:48:28,558
unless it's for something really serious.

841
00:48:28,583 --> 00:48:31,417
-That doesn't even make sense.
-Are you saying I'm thick?

842
00:48:31,792 --> 00:48:32,750
You know you're thick.

843
00:48:33,375 --> 00:48:37,458
Kenny's mate stole a car, Dolly.
He won't be hung for that.

844
00:48:37,583 --> 00:48:38,417
Hanged.

845
00:48:41,000 --> 00:48:42,333
It's "hanged."

846
00:48:47,708 --> 00:48:49,042
I love your toad in the hole, mum.

847
00:48:49,125 --> 00:48:50,125
Thank you, Jackie.

848
00:48:50,917 --> 00:48:51,750
So...

849
00:48:52,167 --> 00:48:53,125
Pamela,

850
00:48:53,542 --> 00:48:55,417
what is your current domestic situation?

851
00:48:55,458 --> 00:48:56,292
Give it a rest, mum.

852
00:48:57,042 --> 00:48:58,667
I work for Ms. Gowling.

853
00:48:59,000 --> 00:49:01,125
That's the wife of counselor Gowling.

854
00:49:01,250 --> 00:49:02,375
You may have heard of him.

855
00:49:02,375 --> 00:49:03,458
And what's it got to do with him?

856
00:49:03,458 --> 00:49:05,250
There's a difference
between right and wrong.

857
00:49:05,250 --> 00:49:05,833
Dad...

858
00:49:06,917 --> 00:49:08,125
I agree with your mother.

859
00:49:08,134 --> 00:49:10,667
It'd be wrong for you two
to be living in sin under our roof.

860
00:49:11,375 --> 00:49:12,250
What's happened to you?

861
00:49:12,875 --> 00:49:14,167
You'll be voting Tory next?

862
00:49:17,792 --> 00:49:19,417
"Play For Today" is on in five minutes.

863
00:49:20,875 --> 00:49:22,042
Can't get BBC.

864
00:49:22,917 --> 00:49:23,690
Why not?

865
00:49:23,875 --> 00:49:25,476
Dad took it out the band-1 coil out.

866
00:49:26,167 --> 00:49:28,833
If you can't get the BBC
you don't have to have a license.

867
00:49:29,184 --> 00:49:31,642
But you've got one still attached
to this side of your television.

868
00:49:31,698 --> 00:49:32,573
No, we haven't.

869
00:49:33,000 --> 00:49:33,833
That's mine.

870
00:49:35,667 --> 00:49:36,667
What did you do that for?

871
00:49:38,042 --> 00:49:39,208
To be normal.

872
00:49:39,333 --> 00:49:41,333
Just fit in the gizmo back in then.

873
00:49:42,625 --> 00:49:43,583
Dad's lost the coil.

874
00:49:44,292 --> 00:49:47,500
So you pay for a TV license
and you still can't receive BBC?

875
00:49:47,500 --> 00:49:49,208
We don't like "Play For Today."

876
00:49:49,500 --> 00:49:51,917
It's just an excuse
for a lot of bad behavior.

877
00:49:56,125 --> 00:49:57,417
Did you set your alarm, luv?

878
00:49:58,417 --> 00:49:59,208
What for?

879
00:49:59,625 --> 00:50:01,417
Aren't you six to two tomorrow?

880
00:50:02,208 --> 00:50:03,750
Ah, you're right.

881
00:50:05,458 --> 00:50:06,250
Don't embrace this.

882
00:50:06,333 --> 00:50:08,817
- Sandwich loaf tomorrow if you can manage.
- No problem.

883
00:50:08,864 --> 00:50:10,301
<i>Will you piss off?</i>

884
00:50:10,750 --> 00:50:11,792
Language!

885
00:50:12,667 --> 00:50:14,500
She's got a nerve.

886
00:50:15,042 --> 00:50:16,875
Count your blessings they're only arguing.

887
00:50:23,208 --> 00:50:26,266
<i>Meet the Quality Street Gang,
seizing up the works of art.</i>

888
00:50:26,542 --> 00:50:28,767
<i>Bast, very smooth. </i>

889
00:50:28,858 --> 00:50:30,875
<i>But inside he's a hard nut.</i>

890
00:50:30,919 --> 00:50:33,542
<i>And Fingers, slim, elegant things.
Everything he touches...</i>

891
00:50:33,625 --> 00:50:35,117
<i>It was there for six weeks.</i>

892
00:50:36,458 --> 00:50:38,589
<i>It must've been a big source of anxiety
for the National Museum staff.</i>

893
00:50:38,648 --> 00:50:39,719
<i>The evidence they put together...</i>

894
00:50:39,833 --> 00:50:41,417
<i>Did he steal before? Never. Never.</i>

895
00:50:41,500 --> 00:50:44,292
<i>Not since the gallery opened in 1824.</i>

896
00:50:52,417 --> 00:50:55,042
<i>What have you been thinking about
the thieves themselves?</i>

897
00:50:55,121 --> 00:50:59,090
<i>Well, we don't think that they were
professional criminals in a strict sense.</i>

898
00:50:59,093 --> 00:50:59,704
<i>We think they...</i>

899
00:50:59,708 --> 00:51:01,500
-Doll.
-What?

900
00:51:01,583 --> 00:51:03,125
<i>...more likely to have been misguided people.</i>

901
00:51:03,292 --> 00:51:04,125
What?

902
00:51:04,200 --> 00:51:05,909
<i>They spoke about charity in their note.</i>

903
00:51:05,958 --> 00:51:06,586
Nothing.

904
00:51:06,722 --> 00:51:10,250
<i>The best of charity they can do
would be returning the portrait.</i>

905
00:51:36,708 --> 00:51:37,875
You like it. I wanna you to say.

906
00:51:57,167 --> 00:51:58,125
I need to piss.

907
00:51:58,833 --> 00:52:00,625
And I thought you were Cary Grant.

908
00:52:41,500 --> 00:52:43,500
-You beauty.
-Dad.

909
00:52:44,250 --> 00:52:46,792
Three horse accumulator, twenty quid.

910
00:52:46,833 --> 00:52:48,685
The Mirror, they're making you an offer.

911
00:52:48,785 --> 00:52:49,986
THE MISSING GOYA AND THE MIRROR

912
00:52:50,086 --> 00:52:52,032
OUR SPORTING OFFER
TO THE MYSTERY LETTER-WRITER

913
00:52:52,068 --> 00:52:53,250
I'll give 'em the painting,

914
00:52:53,333 --> 00:52:56,042
they put it on the exhibition,
charge the public to see the Duke

915
00:52:56,083 --> 00:52:58,125
and give me the proceeds.
Bingo!

916
00:52:58,625 --> 00:52:59,958
How much will the exhibition raise?

917
00:53:00,250 --> 00:53:01,167
Thirty thousand?

918
00:53:01,333 --> 00:53:02,708
Fifty thousand? Who knows?

919
00:53:03,042 --> 00:53:04,958
The painting
has not been out in the news, has it?

920
00:53:05,875 --> 00:53:09,667
I'll be able to pay
for God knows how many TV licenses.

921
00:53:10,333 --> 00:53:12,500
You're not really gonna use it all
on telly licenses?

922
00:53:12,583 --> 00:53:13,250
Why not?

923
00:53:13,712 --> 00:53:16,750
Just saying, who couldn't make use
of a couple of grand?

924
00:53:16,967 --> 00:53:19,333
You think Robin Hood took a rake off?

925
00:53:19,958 --> 00:53:21,667
Jackie, Robin Hood?

926
00:53:22,417 --> 00:53:24,042
What if they are in it with the coppers?

927
00:53:24,292 --> 00:53:25,250
You'll give them the painting.

928
00:53:25,763 --> 00:53:27,708
They're doing cov-op,
and they shut you.

929
00:53:28,292 --> 00:53:29,125
"The Mirror"?

930
00:53:30,250 --> 00:53:32,375
This is the workers' feed
we're talking about.

931
00:53:32,625 --> 00:53:33,917
How are you gonna get them the painting?

932
00:53:35,083 --> 00:53:37,921
We'll worry about that tomorrow.
Tonight, celebration.

933
00:53:37,953 --> 00:53:39,375
Fish supper. Family outing.

934
00:53:39,417 --> 00:53:41,417
No, but Dad, Irene is coming around.

935
00:53:41,750 --> 00:53:43,417
The more the merrier.
Bring her along.

936
00:53:45,125 --> 00:53:48,542
So, Mrs. Bunton,
How did you and Mr. Bunton meet?

937
00:53:48,654 --> 00:53:50,375
At his mother's pub in Tynemouth.

938
00:53:50,667 --> 00:53:52,792
He wiped my table four times.

939
00:53:52,875 --> 00:53:54,375
It worked, you came back.

940
00:53:55,333 --> 00:53:57,458
When she saw he was sweet of me,
his mother said,

941
00:53:57,667 --> 00:53:59,417
"Some of his faults are good faults."

942
00:54:00,090 --> 00:54:02,792
Can't we go to the seaside?
How far is Tynemouth?

943
00:54:02,833 --> 00:54:05,375
You wouldn't wanna be dragged
by your balls from here to Tynemouth.

944
00:54:05,375 --> 00:54:07,125
Kenneth, language.

945
00:54:07,750 --> 00:54:10,458
Irene is new to the family.
And she hasn't been married.

946
00:54:10,542 --> 00:54:11,250
No,

947
00:54:11,708 --> 00:54:13,625
I'm still looking for my prince charming.

948
00:54:13,750 --> 00:54:15,542
Good luck finding him in Benwell.

949
00:54:15,708 --> 00:54:16,833
Benwell village.

950
00:54:17,208 --> 00:54:18,417
You are so harsh, ​​mum.

951
00:54:19,042 --> 00:54:20,750
Here, come here.

952
00:54:20,875 --> 00:54:22,417
No, no, my God.

953
00:54:23,500 --> 00:54:26,292
-Chariot for the Queen.
-Stop it.

954
00:54:27,083 --> 00:54:29,792
Make way for the queen.
Here she is coming.

955
00:54:37,604 --> 00:54:39,900
Four pie and chips, Two corn chips

956
00:54:39,955 --> 00:54:43,292
mashed peas, three
and two pots of tea, please.

957
00:54:43,292 --> 00:54:44,417
Four pie and chips,

958
00:54:44,458 --> 00:54:47,625
two corn chips,
three mashed peas, and two pots of tea.

959
00:54:47,750 --> 00:54:49,625
On second thought I prefer a lemonade.

960
00:54:49,625 --> 00:54:51,083
And a lemonade, please.

961
00:54:51,083 --> 00:54:52,458
And a lemonade.

962
00:54:52,458 --> 00:54:53,375
Anything else?

963
00:54:53,500 --> 00:54:54,875
-What are you gonna do with it?
-With what?

964
00:54:54,917 --> 00:54:55,750
The painting?

965
00:54:56,958 --> 00:54:57,833
What painting?

966
00:54:58,417 --> 00:55:02,500
I don't know, the painting of Duke
of Wellington by Francisco Jose de Goya?

967
00:55:05,125 --> 00:55:05,958
What are you suggesting?

968
00:55:05,958 --> 00:55:09,054
I'm suggesting that if you were to move
the painting somewhere neutral,

969
00:55:09,154 --> 00:55:10,504
safe, out of the house,

970
00:55:10,604 --> 00:55:12,702
I could tell the authorities
where it is,

971
00:55:12,726 --> 00:55:14,458
and we could split the
five thousand reward.

972
00:55:14,792 --> 00:55:16,417
-Or?
-Or...

973
00:55:16,625 --> 00:55:18,415
You can hang on to it.

974
00:55:18,869 --> 00:55:21,655
And one day some very pop in mind assistant
tells the police everything

975
00:55:21,679 --> 00:55:22,641
and gets all the money.

976
00:55:23,042 --> 00:55:24,458
But we wouldn't want that to happen,
would we?

977
00:55:24,458 --> 00:55:25,792
Because I like you.

978
00:55:25,792 --> 00:55:27,583
And you would have to go to prison.

979
00:55:28,208 --> 00:55:29,708
-Two and a half thousand?
-Each.

980
00:55:30,333 --> 00:55:33,795
-I can't do what I need to do with 2500.
-What do you wanna do?

981
00:55:34,208 --> 00:55:36,833
-Help people.
-Or help yourself more like.

982
00:55:37,458 --> 00:55:38,875
Are you short of money?

983
00:55:39,083 --> 00:55:40,125
Who isn't?

984
00:55:44,792 --> 00:55:46,042
She knows about it.

985
00:55:46,417 --> 00:55:47,250
What?

986
00:55:47,917 --> 00:55:48,833
The Duke.

987
00:55:49,292 --> 00:55:50,542
-Who? Mum?
-Pammy.

988
00:55:50,625 --> 00:55:52,750
She's after the reward money,
she wants to split it with me.

989
00:55:52,792 --> 00:55:54,417
-But what about the "Mirror" affair?
-I know.

990
00:55:54,500 --> 00:55:56,583
But if she goes to the police now,
we're done for.

991
00:55:56,875 --> 00:55:59,417
So, take it back tonight,
Maybe they'll go easy on me.

992
00:56:01,746 --> 00:56:04,125
-What would you tell mum?
-What can I tell her?

993
00:56:04,333 --> 00:56:06,594
Here, I'm gonna slip back.
Keep them entertained.

994
00:56:06,694 --> 00:56:08,288
-What am I supposed to do?
-I do not know.

995
00:56:08,388 --> 00:56:09,694
Take them to the "green tree."

996
00:56:21,500 --> 00:56:22,333
Kempton?

997
00:56:44,125 --> 00:56:45,333
I can explain.

998
00:56:50,125 --> 00:56:51,333
Oh my good God.

999
00:56:58,958 --> 00:56:59,958
It was you?

1000
00:57:02,083 --> 00:57:03,792
You stole the painting?

1001
00:57:03,958 --> 00:57:05,870
It's not theft, for money,

1002
00:57:07,238 --> 00:57:08,500
it's for the campaign.

1003
00:57:11,667 --> 00:57:12,500
You're a madman.

1004
00:57:14,042 --> 00:57:15,375
I'm living with the madman.

1005
00:57:17,125 --> 00:57:18,833
But you swore to me, you promised.

1006
00:57:18,833 --> 00:57:19,958
If you involved our Jackie in this--

1007
00:57:19,958 --> 00:57:21,625
Jackie has nothing to do with it.

1008
00:57:21,625 --> 00:57:23,667
Why was he wearing rubber gloves
half of the time then?

1009
00:57:23,667 --> 00:57:24,833
He helped me built the panel.

1010
00:57:24,917 --> 00:57:25,875
So he is involved.

1011
00:57:25,958 --> 00:57:29,167
He hasn't touched the painting.
Not without rubber gloves on.

1012
00:57:30,500 --> 00:57:31,333
I'm shaking.

1013
00:57:31,833 --> 00:57:32,667
It's the shock.

1014
00:57:32,750 --> 00:57:35,667
Shock, yes, I'm shocked.
There's a stolen masterpiece in my wardrobe.

1015
00:57:35,708 --> 00:57:36,542
I'm taking it back.

1016
00:57:37,542 --> 00:57:39,208
Anything else I need to know?

1017
00:57:40,417 --> 00:57:42,958
-I lost my job at the bakery.
- There's a surprise.

1018
00:57:42,958 --> 00:57:45,208
I stood up against racial bigotry.

1019
00:57:45,542 --> 00:57:47,542
-Well done.
-Someone had to say something.

1020
00:57:47,583 --> 00:57:50,917
Yes, and it's called Martin Luther
bloody King. Not Kempton Bunton.

1021
00:57:50,958 --> 00:57:52,917
You swore you'd get a job.

1022
00:57:53,667 --> 00:57:55,708
We had an agreement.

1023
00:57:55,958 --> 00:57:56,917
You lied.

1024
00:57:58,083 --> 00:58:00,542
You lied. You lied
when you said all of this would stop.

1025
00:58:00,625 --> 00:58:01,625
You don't care, do you?

1026
00:58:01,625 --> 00:58:05,250
No, no. It's just me, me, me, isn't it?
No one else exists.

1027
00:58:06,750 --> 00:58:08,167
Pammy knows I've got it.

1028
00:58:09,708 --> 00:58:10,542
Oh Heavens.

1029
00:58:11,125 --> 00:58:14,333
There's a reward, five thousand.
She's after the money, so if...

1030
00:58:14,375 --> 00:58:16,583
-She'll go to the police.
-It's possible but...

1031
00:58:16,583 --> 00:58:18,958
-And they'll come here.
-Yet only if it's...

1032
00:58:19,042 --> 00:58:20,292
In the street.

1033
00:58:20,917 --> 00:58:22,708
They'll drag you out in handcuffs.

1034
00:58:22,750 --> 00:58:26,328
-Listen, calm down.
-I can't calm down. I'm at top pitch.

1035
00:58:26,358 --> 00:58:30,559
I'm taking the painting
back to London tonight quietly.

1036
00:58:30,583 --> 00:58:33,250
That would be the best thing
for us, for all of us.

1037
00:58:33,583 --> 00:58:35,292
I might have to do a bit of time.

1038
00:58:35,375 --> 00:58:38,500
It's a hundred and forty thousand
pound painting. You'll do life.

1039
00:58:38,667 --> 00:58:40,833
No, luv, it's not like that.
I was gonna use it...

1040
00:58:41,667 --> 00:58:43,917
you know,
the greater good of mankind.

1041
00:58:43,958 --> 00:58:46,333
Mankind? What about your own kind?

1042
00:58:47,167 --> 00:58:48,625
You've broken this family.

1043
00:58:48,698 --> 00:58:49,864
You're disgusting.

1044
00:58:50,417 --> 00:58:53,375
Get out, you bastard. Just get out!

1045
00:59:04,958 --> 00:59:05,833
Dad.

1046
00:59:06,708 --> 00:59:08,458
Dad, I'm coming with you.

1047
00:59:08,667 --> 00:59:11,529
No, you're not. This is my thing.
It has nothing to do with you.

1048
00:59:11,629 --> 00:59:13,558
Now stay and look after your mother.

1049
01:00:04,542 --> 01:00:05,375
Excuse me, sir.

1050
01:00:06,792 --> 01:00:08,417
Are you taking one of our paintings?

1051
01:00:09,583 --> 01:00:11,708
No sir, I'm bringing one back.

1052
01:00:13,875 --> 01:00:16,458
<i>Meanwhile, in an unexpected development,</i>

1053
01:00:16,542 --> 01:00:20,285
<i>Goya's portrait of the Duke of Wellington
has been returned by hand</i>

1054
01:00:20,333 --> 01:00:23,167
<i>to where it was stolen
from London's National Gallery.</i>

1055
01:00:23,375 --> 01:00:25,625
<i>At a press conference
an official described</i>

1056
01:00:25,625 --> 01:00:28,669
<i>how a member of the public
has simply walked in off the streets</i>

1057
01:00:28,769 --> 01:00:32,361
<i>with the painting under his arm
wrapped up in a bit of old brown paper.</i>

1058
01:00:32,583 --> 01:00:35,958
<i>And when our reporter tried it
nobody batted an eyelid.</i>

1059
01:00:36,708 --> 01:00:37,551
...looked up and said,

1060
01:00:37,660 --> 01:00:40,222
"Mr. Hutchinson, are you trying
to show this court content?"

1061
01:00:40,322 --> 01:00:43,083
I said, "My Lord, no.
I'm actually trying to hide it."

1062
01:00:43,958 --> 01:00:46,500
First rule of advocacy:
don't be funnier than the judge.

1063
01:00:46,583 --> 01:00:47,333
Yes.

1064
01:00:47,417 --> 01:00:48,125
Mr. Bunton,

1065
01:00:48,375 --> 01:00:50,208
I'm your barrister, Jeremy Hutchinson.

1066
01:00:51,042 --> 01:00:53,833
That's a shame, I thought
you were gonna offer me a gin and tonic.

1067
01:00:54,583 --> 01:00:55,833
While I'm out tonight

1068
01:00:56,042 --> 01:00:58,125
my wife is in a Cherry orchard.

1069
01:00:58,500 --> 01:00:59,833
Playing "Ranevskaya"?

1070
01:01:00,292 --> 01:01:00,958
Indeed.

1071
01:01:02,042 --> 01:01:04,708
Like life I can never decide
if the cherry orchard,

1072
01:01:04,708 --> 01:01:06,375
is a tragedy or a farce.

1073
01:01:06,417 --> 01:01:07,292
Do you know the play?

1074
01:01:07,917 --> 01:01:09,500
It's one of my favorites.

1075
01:01:09,583 --> 01:01:11,208
I lost a child myself.

1076
01:01:11,958 --> 01:01:12,917
I'm sorry.

1077
01:01:14,125 --> 01:01:15,375
I'm a playwright.

1078
01:01:15,958 --> 01:01:18,167
As a matter of fact,
I prefer Chekhov to Shakespeare.

1079
01:01:18,167 --> 01:01:20,458
For me,
the Bard is overfond of his kings.

1080
01:01:20,833 --> 01:01:22,917
Eric Crowther, junior counselor.

1081
01:01:23,125 --> 01:01:26,429
Mr. Hutchinson's wife
is the actress Dame Peggy Ashcroft.

1082
01:01:26,454 --> 01:01:27,079
Yes.

1083
01:01:28,375 --> 01:01:29,625
You are a lucky man.

1084
01:01:29,917 --> 01:01:30,708
Well...

1085
01:01:31,958 --> 01:01:33,250
Court number one, eh?

1086
01:01:33,833 --> 01:01:35,250
The old Bailey.

1087
01:01:35,375 --> 01:01:37,708
The crucible of British criminal justice.

1088
01:01:37,750 --> 01:01:39,833
-Dr. Crippen.
-Derek Bentley.

1089
01:01:39,958 --> 01:01:41,125
Ruth Ellis.

1090
01:01:41,917 --> 01:01:43,250
They were all hung.

1091
01:01:43,708 --> 01:01:44,445
I mean hanged.

1092
01:01:44,545 --> 01:01:47,393
They didn't have Mr. Hutchinson
defending them.

1093
01:01:47,417 --> 01:01:48,625
Who's prosecuting?

1094
01:01:48,833 --> 01:01:50,333
Neddie Cussen.

1095
01:01:51,208 --> 01:01:53,083
-Score is seven to two.
-To you?

1096
01:01:53,625 --> 01:01:54,542
To him.

1097
01:01:54,833 --> 01:01:56,417
He was born prosecutor, Neddie.

1098
01:01:56,792 --> 01:01:59,500
Defendants are always guilty
until proven innocent.

1099
01:02:00,022 --> 01:02:01,208
Can you get me off?

1100
01:02:02,583 --> 01:02:03,500
Mr. Bunton,

1101
01:02:04,958 --> 01:02:07,917
You've returned the Goya by hand,
and confessed to the theft.

1102
01:02:07,917 --> 01:02:10,958
You gave the police
a detailed explanation of how you stole it.

1103
01:02:10,958 --> 01:02:12,875
And you've explained your motive.

1104
01:02:14,042 --> 01:02:15,250
Can I get you off?

1105
01:02:17,917 --> 01:02:19,583
Almost certainly not.

1106
01:02:21,625 --> 01:02:24,417
<i>Meanwhile, Kempton Bunton,
a Newcastle man,</i>

1107
01:02:24,417 --> 01:02:27,875
<i>accused of stealing Goya's portrait
of the Duke of Wellington,</i>

1108
01:02:27,875 --> 01:02:31,792
<i>arrived at the Old Bailey this morning
for the first day of his trial.</i>

1109
01:02:31,875 --> 01:02:33,500
<i>And it was quite an entrance.</i>

1110
01:02:33,542 --> 01:02:36,333
<i>-Did you steal the Goya, Mr. Bunton?
-No, I borrowed it.</i>

1111
01:02:36,917 --> 01:02:39,667
<i>-Why?
-For the greater good.</i>

1112
01:02:40,333 --> 01:02:41,750
We can still get there.

1113
01:02:44,208 --> 01:02:46,333
He's made his bed, he can lie in it.

1114
01:02:50,625 --> 01:02:54,583
<i>The most of the day was taken of
with empaneling the twelve citizens.</i>

1115
01:02:54,792 --> 01:02:56,625
<i>Twelve good men and women</i>

1116
01:02:56,625 --> 01:02:59,583
<i>who will tomorrow begin to hear
what promises to be</i>

1117
01:02:59,583 --> 01:03:03,333
<i>one of the most eagerly awaited
criminal trial since the war.</i>

1118
01:03:03,583 --> 01:03:06,042
<i>Another triumph
for the Duke of Wellington.</i>

1119
01:03:06,125 --> 01:03:09,958
<i>And as the queues begin to gather
for access to the public gallery,</i>

1120
01:03:09,958 --> 01:03:13,292
<i>there is no doubt
that even by the Old Bailey standards</i>

1121
01:03:13,375 --> 01:03:16,250
<i>this one looks like being
a very off ticket.</i>

1122
01:03:22,833 --> 01:03:25,208
-Are you Kempton Bunton?
-Aye.

1123
01:03:25,583 --> 01:03:29,250
But not named after Kempton Race track
as some might have it.

1124
01:03:30,333 --> 01:03:32,875
Even though it is probable
that I was conceived there.

1125
01:03:32,958 --> 01:03:34,583
It is a "yes" or "no" answer?

1126
01:03:35,250 --> 01:03:36,500
Yes, My Lord.

1127
01:03:36,833 --> 01:03:40,625
My mother named me after Kempton Cannon.
The jockey who rode St. Amanat.

1128
01:03:40,625 --> 01:03:42,333
The winner of that year's derby.

1129
01:03:43,125 --> 01:03:44,583
Do you want me to explain Bunton?

1130
01:03:44,625 --> 01:03:46,667
I didn't want you to explain Kempton.

1131
01:03:48,250 --> 01:03:49,083
Charges.

1132
01:03:50,958 --> 01:03:55,431
Kempton Bunton, you are charged
set on the 21st March, 1961.

1133
01:03:55,792 --> 01:03:58,750
You stole a picture frame
to the value of 80 pounds,

1134
01:03:58,750 --> 01:04:00,583
property of the National Gallery.

1135
01:04:00,708 --> 01:04:02,958
How do you plead? Guilty or not guilty?

1136
01:04:02,958 --> 01:04:04,083
Not guilty.

1137
01:04:04,167 --> 01:04:07,458
In the second count,
you are charged set on the same day,

1138
01:04:07,458 --> 01:04:09,458
you stole from the National Gallery,

1139
01:04:09,667 --> 01:04:14,875
the portrait of the Duke of Wellington
by the artist Francesco Goya,

1140
01:04:14,917 --> 01:04:18,125
to the value of
one hundred and forty thousand pounds.

1141
01:04:18,375 --> 01:04:21,542
-How do you plead? Guilty or not guilty?
-Not guilty.

1142
01:04:21,542 --> 01:04:22,583
Yes!

1143
01:04:24,333 --> 01:04:26,667
To those unfamiliar
with court proceedings,

1144
01:04:26,708 --> 01:04:28,292
that was the plea, not the verdict.

1145
01:04:30,125 --> 01:04:34,227
Kempton Bunton, you are further charged
that following the theft of the portrait

1146
01:04:34,327 --> 01:04:36,956
you made demands with menaces
for its return.

1147
01:04:37,583 --> 01:04:39,500
Do you plead guilty or not guilty?

1148
01:04:39,583 --> 01:04:40,708
Not guilty.

1149
01:04:40,792 --> 01:04:44,513
And that you created a public nuisance
by depriving members of the public

1150
01:04:44,613 --> 01:04:46,802
of the opportunity to view the portrait.

1151
01:04:47,125 --> 01:04:49,333
Do you plead guilty or not guilty?

1152
01:04:49,333 --> 01:04:50,833
Same again, luv, not guilty.

1153
01:04:52,708 --> 01:04:53,417
Mr. Cussen.

1154
01:04:55,333 --> 01:04:56,333
Thank you, My Lord.

1155
01:04:56,333 --> 01:04:58,583
And at 5 a.m.

1156
01:04:58,583 --> 01:05:02,500
when you returned from your rest break,
what did you see?

1157
01:05:02,958 --> 01:05:05,250
The painting was gone, sir.
Clearly stolen.

1158
01:05:06,333 --> 01:05:07,042
Thank you.

1159
01:05:07,625 --> 01:05:09,822
Mr. Edbury, if you could remain there

1160
01:05:09,991 --> 01:05:12,224
my defense friend
will have some questions for you.**

1161
01:05:15,292 --> 01:05:16,208
Mr. Hutchinson.

1162
01:05:18,667 --> 01:05:19,792
No questions, My Lord.

1163
01:05:20,792 --> 01:05:25,667
The conception, design, and execution
of this act was solely,

1164
01:05:25,750 --> 01:05:27,625
singly and entirely my own.

1165
01:05:28,250 --> 01:05:30,208
And that statement is signed?

1166
01:05:30,458 --> 01:05:32,042
Kempton Bunton.

1167
01:05:32,875 --> 01:05:34,625
Thank you, detective inspector.

1168
01:05:34,708 --> 01:05:37,708
If you would stay there Mr. Hutchinson
will have some questions for you.

1169
01:05:40,708 --> 01:05:42,083
Mr. Hutchinson.

1170
01:05:42,958 --> 01:05:45,667
The defense has no questions
for this witness.

1171
01:05:47,250 --> 01:05:49,167
At this rate we'll be finished by tea.

1172
01:05:50,083 --> 01:05:53,958
And Dr. Unsworth, what is
your professional opinion of the hand?

1173
01:05:54,750 --> 01:05:57,542
The child-like scrawl
across all the ransom note is

1174
01:05:57,583 --> 01:05:59,917
when compared to his normal script

1175
01:06:00,375 --> 01:06:03,792
unequivocally the feebly disguised hand
of the accused, Mr. Bunton.

1176
01:06:04,250 --> 01:06:07,958
I'm grateful, Dr. Unsworth.
if you would remain on stand.

1177
01:06:08,625 --> 01:06:12,792
Any cross examination, Mr. Hutchinson?
Or are you trying to give it up?

1178
01:06:14,625 --> 01:06:16,583
The defense has no questions
for this witness.

1179
01:06:24,833 --> 01:06:25,875
What are you doing?

1180
01:06:25,875 --> 01:06:27,833
The dirt in this house.

1181
01:06:27,833 --> 01:06:28,542
Stop it.

1182
01:06:28,542 --> 01:06:30,367
Someone has got to keep this place clean,

1183
01:06:30,467 --> 01:06:33,833
Lord knows your father
will drag us into the gutter.

1184
01:06:34,792 --> 01:06:35,708
That's not true.

1185
01:06:36,333 --> 01:06:38,083
And it's not dad's fault Marian died.

1186
01:06:38,417 --> 01:06:40,958
He bought her that bike,
so as far as he's concerned he killed her.

1187
01:06:41,125 --> 01:06:42,333
Do you think I don't know that?

1188
01:06:42,375 --> 01:06:44,417
Tell him then, talk about it.

1189
01:06:44,750 --> 01:06:47,750
Why do you think he does his plays,
and his leaflets and petitions?

1190
01:06:47,750 --> 01:06:49,958
-Defend him all you like.
-I stole the painting.

1191
01:06:51,083 --> 01:06:54,083
Did you hear me? I stole the Goya.

1192
01:06:55,250 --> 01:06:55,875
What?

1193
01:06:57,708 --> 01:06:58,250
No.

1194
01:06:58,958 --> 01:07:01,625
No, you didn't take that painting.
No, you did not.

1195
01:07:01,667 --> 01:07:03,083
Aye, it was me.

1196
01:07:03,458 --> 01:07:03,958
Not dad.

1197
01:07:05,875 --> 01:07:09,542
No, please, just please tell me
it's all nonsense, Jackie Bunton.

1198
01:07:11,542 --> 01:07:12,958
-Oh my God, I'm shaking.
-Mum?

1199
01:07:13,500 --> 01:07:14,375
I'm shaking.

1200
01:07:14,375 --> 01:07:16,667
Look at me, I'm shaking.

1201
01:07:16,667 --> 01:07:18,375
Stop it,
you're just making yourself shake.

1202
01:07:18,375 --> 01:07:19,125
Sit down.

1203
01:07:24,875 --> 01:07:26,292
When did you go to London?

1204
01:07:29,667 --> 01:07:31,083
It was that week I took off work.

1205
01:07:31,167 --> 01:07:31,958
But you...

1206
01:07:32,458 --> 01:07:34,583
You said you went to Leeds.

1207
01:07:36,042 --> 01:07:37,292
You lied.

1208
01:07:37,750 --> 01:07:40,070
I'm sick of you skivvying for lady Mogue.**

1209
01:07:40,333 --> 01:07:41,958
Sick of 'em all laughing at dad.

1210
01:07:42,750 --> 01:07:44,375
I thought the painting might be...

1211
01:07:44,745 --> 01:07:46,125
I thought it might change everything.

1212
01:07:46,125 --> 01:07:47,292
So you are a liar

1213
01:07:47,500 --> 01:07:48,458
and a thief.

1214
01:07:48,498 --> 01:07:50,018
I just thought if he had something

1215
01:07:50,118 --> 01:07:52,582
them bloody tuffs wanted
they'd have to listen...

1216
01:07:52,792 --> 01:07:54,125
You know, his TV crusade.

1217
01:07:54,125 --> 01:07:56,750
Crusade? Jesus Christ is he now?

1218
01:08:01,792 --> 01:08:02,833
But how?

1219
01:08:03,667 --> 01:08:05,750
I mean how did you take it?

1220
01:08:07,333 --> 01:08:08,833
I cased the gallery.

1221
01:08:10,125 --> 01:08:11,917
<i>Goya was just out there on an easel.</i>

1222
01:08:12,625 --> 01:08:14,125
<i>Not even guard standing by it.</i>

1223
01:08:15,750 --> 01:08:16,875
<i>All I had to do</i>

1224
01:08:16,957 --> 01:08:18,542
<i>was find somewhere I could break in.</i>

1225
01:08:20,417 --> 01:08:21,707
<i>I went to the toilet,</i>

1226
01:08:22,667 --> 01:08:25,207
<i>and I opened the toilet window
and leaned down.</i>

1227
01:08:26,250 --> 01:08:28,012
<i>There was a courtyard below</i>

1228
01:08:28,457 --> 01:08:30,500
<i>with all builder stuff and ladders.</i>

1229
01:08:31,500 --> 01:08:32,500
Excuse me.

1230
01:08:32,667 --> 01:08:35,250
<i>I went up to the security fella.
And asked him how you get a job.</i>

1231
01:08:35,250 --> 01:08:36,500
You can try the office.

1232
01:08:36,707 --> 01:08:38,207
Cleaners work early mornings.

1233
01:08:38,375 --> 01:08:39,542
Four thirty.

1234
01:08:40,250 --> 01:08:42,707
Get a night rate, son. Lucky buggers.

1235
01:08:43,457 --> 01:08:44,375
I was born lucky.

1236
01:08:45,832 --> 01:08:47,207
<i>Then, I figured...</i>

1237
01:08:47,750 --> 01:08:51,167
<i>If the cleaners were half past four
they'd have to turn the alarms off.</i>

1238
01:08:52,125 --> 01:08:53,750
<i>So I went back early morning.</i>

1239
01:08:54,542 --> 01:08:56,832
<i>Put a ladder up
just below the toilet window.</i>

1240
01:08:58,082 --> 01:08:58,917
<i>Climbed up and...</i>

1241
01:09:00,207 --> 01:09:03,332
<i>I could hear one of them,
automatic floor polishers.</i>

1242
01:09:04,500 --> 01:09:06,957
<i>So I waited until he passed and then...</i>

1243
01:09:07,042 --> 01:09:07,957
NOW WASH YOUR HANDS

1244
01:09:08,832 --> 01:09:10,417
<i>I just walked across the floor.</i>

1245
01:09:10,750 --> 01:09:12,582
I don't suppose
you've ever been to Newcastle.

1246
01:09:19,417 --> 01:09:21,332
What did your father say
when you told him?

1247
01:09:22,707 --> 01:09:23,917
Fucking hell!

1248
01:09:23,957 --> 01:09:25,542
-What do you think?
-I think...

1249
01:09:25,832 --> 01:09:27,042
Fucking hell!

1250
01:09:27,125 --> 01:09:28,500
A hundred and forty grand.

1251
01:09:28,542 --> 01:09:30,417
If you can sell it which you can't.

1252
01:09:30,917 --> 01:09:31,582
I know.

1253
01:09:31,917 --> 01:09:32,750
I'm not daft.

1254
01:09:32,875 --> 01:09:35,917
But for pictures the insurance
will pay out 10 percent for safe return.

1255
01:09:35,957 --> 01:09:37,207
Have you got a screw loose?

1256
01:09:37,250 --> 01:09:39,625
-Are you angry with this?
-Angry? No.

1257
01:09:39,651 --> 01:09:41,707
I'm furious, you stupid penis

1258
01:09:41,732 --> 01:09:44,107
you've nicked the best known painting
on the planet.

1259
01:09:44,245 --> 01:09:45,035
Good lord.

1260
01:09:45,104 --> 01:09:47,979
Why can't we use it
to get them free telly licenses?

1261
01:09:48,094 --> 01:09:49,298
Blackmail the bastards.

1262
01:09:49,391 --> 01:09:52,207
Or to bargain a ransom? To betterment
of none other than common men?

1263
01:09:53,375 --> 01:09:54,500
One problem.

1264
01:09:56,125 --> 01:09:56,833
What's that?

1265
01:09:57,375 --> 01:09:58,417
Two words.

1266
01:09:58,708 --> 01:10:00,875
Mrs. Dorothy Bunton.

1267
01:10:03,258 --> 01:10:04,435
We have to hide it from her.

1268
01:10:04,535 --> 01:10:07,518
You can't hide anything from a woman
in her own house.

1269
01:10:07,542 --> 01:10:09,875
No, if she finds it I stole it.

1270
01:10:10,125 --> 01:10:11,958
-I'm not having you take the blame.
-I...

1271
01:10:11,958 --> 01:10:12,958
stole it.

1272
01:10:16,333 --> 01:10:18,208
On the telly it was in the frame.

1273
01:10:18,583 --> 01:10:19,417
Shit.

1274
01:10:20,417 --> 01:10:21,250
I took it off.

1275
01:10:21,866 --> 01:10:24,324
I must've left it under the bed
in my digs. Sorry.

1276
01:10:24,482 --> 01:10:27,042
You'd lose your balls
if they weren't in a bag.

1277
01:10:30,137 --> 01:10:32,054
It's not very good, is it?

1278
01:10:38,875 --> 01:10:41,625
THE GIRL ON THE BICYCLE.

1279
01:11:07,125 --> 01:11:10,773
I do solemnly, sincerely
and truly declare

1280
01:11:11,083 --> 01:11:12,208
and affirm

1281
01:11:12,542 --> 01:11:14,625
that the evidence I shall give

1282
01:11:14,958 --> 01:11:16,333
shall be the truth,

1283
01:11:16,667 --> 01:11:19,885
the whole truth,
and nothing but the truth.

1284
01:11:20,038 --> 01:11:22,037
Excuse me. Thank you.

1285
01:11:28,125 --> 01:11:30,083
How old are you, Mr. Bunton?

1286
01:11:30,792 --> 01:11:33,042
I don't know. I feel about 23.

1287
01:11:33,917 --> 01:11:35,208
You don't know
your date of birth?

1288
01:11:35,708 --> 01:11:37,375
I never had a birth certificate.

1289
01:11:37,667 --> 01:11:39,208
1900 I think.

1290
01:11:39,458 --> 01:11:41,333
Do you know where you were born?

1291
01:11:41,542 --> 01:11:42,667
The back bedroom.

1292
01:11:44,437 --> 01:11:46,250
Or your mother's house in Newcastle?

1293
01:11:46,625 --> 01:11:47,250
Byker.

1294
01:11:47,458 --> 01:11:49,458
If a Newcastle was a dog,

1295
01:11:49,500 --> 01:11:50,833
you lifted its tail,

1296
01:11:50,833 --> 01:11:52,500
that hole there, that's Byker.

1297
01:11:54,958 --> 01:11:56,375
Your father...

1298
01:11:56,417 --> 01:11:59,250
fought in the
first world war at Ypres.

1299
01:11:59,333 --> 01:12:01,375
Wipers, he wasn't an officer.

1300
01:12:01,875 --> 01:12:03,458
He came back in a wheelchair?

1301
01:12:03,667 --> 01:12:04,292
Aye.

1302
01:12:04,667 --> 01:12:06,042
A tank ran over his legs.

1303
01:12:06,417 --> 01:12:08,583
How did he feel
about the Germans after that?

1304
01:12:08,917 --> 01:12:10,208
Never a bad word.

1305
01:12:10,375 --> 01:12:11,917
The Germans didn't have tanks.

1306
01:12:12,625 --> 01:12:14,250
You helped him to run his business.

1307
01:12:14,333 --> 01:12:17,250
Aye, he was a street bookie,
and I did his running for him.

1308
01:12:17,333 --> 01:12:20,958
It was illegal. But you could bribe
the beat bobby with 12 shillings.

1309
01:12:21,208 --> 01:12:22,125
I was as guilty as anybody.

1310
01:12:22,167 --> 01:12:24,721
And who hasn't been guilty
of a youthful indiscretion?

1311
01:12:24,792 --> 01:12:28,167
Ladies and gentlemen of the jury...
The past, as they say

1312
01:12:28,534 --> 01:12:29,500
is another country.

1313
01:12:30,206 --> 01:12:31,289
Your father died.

1314
01:12:31,458 --> 01:12:34,250
And you lived with your mother
who ran pubs?

1315
01:12:34,333 --> 01:12:34,917
Aye.

1316
01:12:34,958 --> 01:12:38,208
It was a rough game, but she had
a left hook like Henry Cooper's.

1317
01:12:38,292 --> 01:12:40,292
Luckily she didn't cut quite as easy.

1318
01:12:40,958 --> 01:12:44,583
In WWII you were refused service
on medical grounds?

1319
01:12:44,875 --> 01:12:46,500
I've done my bit. I drove lorries.

1320
01:12:46,958 --> 01:12:48,125
You married young?

1321
01:12:48,500 --> 01:12:49,542
I have to marry.

1322
01:12:49,708 --> 01:12:50,667
Had to marry?

1323
01:12:51,833 --> 01:12:52,667
It was love.

1324
01:12:53,417 --> 01:12:55,125
The decision was made for me.

1325
01:12:56,958 --> 01:13:00,125
Did you intend to steal this painting
in a sense of...

1326
01:13:00,167 --> 01:13:03,333
permanently depriving the gallery of it?

1327
01:13:03,542 --> 01:13:04,375
Never.

1328
01:13:04,875 --> 01:13:07,625
Did you ever demand money
with menaces at any time from anyone?

1329
01:13:08,083 --> 01:13:08,958
No, sir.

1330
01:13:09,083 --> 01:13:10,417
In 1960,

1331
01:13:10,750 --> 01:13:14,958
did you communicate with the post office
about your TV license?

1332
01:13:14,958 --> 01:13:18,750
Aye, I told them I had no intention
of paying it because I couldn't receive BBC.

1333
01:13:18,750 --> 01:13:21,083
-You went to prison for not paying?
-I did.

1334
01:13:21,375 --> 01:13:22,292
On your release,

1335
01:13:22,583 --> 01:13:25,125
you continued to campaign for free TV,

1336
01:13:25,375 --> 01:13:28,167
for pensioners and war veterans,
is that correct?

1337
01:13:28,292 --> 01:13:29,542
I could afford a license myself,

1338
01:13:29,542 --> 01:13:31,625
it was about principle of the thing.

1339
01:13:31,625 --> 01:13:34,458
All my life I've looked out for
other people and got into trouble for it.

1340
01:13:34,792 --> 01:13:35,958
When did that begin,

1341
01:13:36,333 --> 01:13:37,417
looking out for others?

1342
01:13:39,042 --> 01:13:40,708
I was about 14.

1343
01:13:41,958 --> 01:13:43,208
Summer holidays.

1344
01:13:43,667 --> 01:13:47,125
I've just finished reading
Joseph Conrad's "Heart of Darkness"

1345
01:13:47,417 --> 01:13:49,708
and I felt the need to explore Sunderland.

1346
01:13:51,875 --> 01:13:55,500
But I got distracted and found myself
on a South Shields beach.

1347
01:13:56,417 --> 01:13:58,583
I chugged myself into sea to cool down.

1348
01:13:59,083 --> 01:14:01,417
A rip tide dragged me out.

1349
01:14:01,958 --> 01:14:03,792
I was on my own, exhausted,

1350
01:14:03,792 --> 01:14:04,917
about a mile out,

1351
01:14:04,917 --> 01:14:06,708
and I knew
there was no way I'd get back in.

1352
01:14:07,625 --> 01:14:08,833
But I had faith,

1353
01:14:09,333 --> 01:14:10,333
not in God,

1354
01:14:10,792 --> 01:14:11,833
but in people.

1355
01:14:13,076 --> 01:14:15,719
I knew some nosy buggerer
would see a pair of clothes on the beach

1356
01:14:15,819 --> 01:14:17,749
and put two and two together.

1357
01:14:18,625 --> 01:14:20,083
So I trusted in that

1358
01:14:20,667 --> 01:14:21,600
and waited.

1359
01:14:23,458 --> 01:14:24,958
Conserved my energy

1360
01:14:25,417 --> 01:14:26,333
by floating,

1361
01:14:27,042 --> 01:14:27,958
not swimming.

1362
01:14:29,500 --> 01:14:30,833
Looked at the sky...

1363
01:14:31,583 --> 01:14:32,833
Smile on my face.

1364
01:14:33,708 --> 01:14:35,333
You could call it trust.

1365
01:14:36,542 --> 01:14:37,667
An hour later

1366
01:14:38,125 --> 01:14:41,167
the light boat pulls up alongside
and holds me in.

1367
01:14:41,292 --> 01:14:44,083
The skipper was a milkman from Blyth.

1368
01:14:44,417 --> 01:14:46,500
By all accounts a bit of a bastard.

1369
01:14:47,417 --> 01:14:48,417
Excuse my French.

1370
01:14:49,083 --> 01:14:52,208
You know, as a milkman I mean.
But there's good and bad in all of us.

1371
01:14:52,792 --> 01:14:54,025
He saved my life that day.

1372
01:14:54,125 --> 01:14:56,513
It could've been anyone
but I knew someone would.

1373
01:14:56,958 --> 01:14:59,208
I'm not me without you, do you get me?

1374
01:14:59,542 --> 01:15:00,667
We all need each other.

1375
01:15:00,833 --> 01:15:02,292
No, you are me.

1376
01:15:02,875 --> 01:15:06,458
It's you that makes me <i>me</i>
and it's me that makes you <i>you</i>.

1377
01:15:06,917 --> 01:15:08,667
Humanity is a collective project.

1378
01:15:08,958 --> 01:15:12,042
Look, on my own I'm a single brick.

1379
01:15:12,375 --> 01:15:13,250
A bit useless.

1380
01:15:14,176 --> 01:15:15,917
What good is a brick on its tod?

1381
01:15:16,273 --> 01:15:18,786
But you put a lot of bricks together,
you get a building,

1382
01:15:18,886 --> 01:15:20,996
you build a building, you create a shadow.

1383
01:15:21,375 --> 01:15:23,292
Already you've changed the world.

1384
01:15:23,460 --> 01:15:25,958
Your philosophy,
I think it earns the appellation.

1385
01:15:26,125 --> 01:15:29,958
How did you apply this thinking
to your own struggle?

1386
01:15:31,417 --> 01:15:34,875
You can't help the dead
but you can be inspired by them.

1387
01:15:34,875 --> 01:15:39,125
Some of them kids that this country sent out
to France and Belgium in 1914 came back.

1388
01:15:39,500 --> 01:15:43,250
They are over 65 now. Pension
has been not two pennies to rub together.

1389
01:15:43,625 --> 01:15:45,292
And isolation

1390
01:15:45,500 --> 01:15:49,125
or not being connected
to use the modern lingo is no kind of life.

1391
01:15:49,458 --> 01:15:53,417
So what you grandly call my philosophy,
that "I'm you, you're me" thing

1392
01:15:53,542 --> 01:15:55,208
tells me that every time

1393
01:15:55,583 --> 01:15:57,625
someone gets cut off
from the rest of us.

1394
01:15:58,083 --> 01:15:59,833
This nation, this country

1395
01:15:59,958 --> 01:16:01,875
becomes a foot shorter.

1396
01:16:14,333 --> 01:16:16,208
MARIAN BUNTON
1930-1946

1397
01:16:16,750 --> 01:16:17,583
Mr. Bunton,

1398
01:16:18,125 --> 01:16:21,500
I suspect the jury are asking themselves
how any of this

1399
01:16:22,208 --> 01:16:24,042
applies to the theft of the Goya.

1400
01:16:24,125 --> 01:16:26,500
-I saw on the news.
-The ITV news?

1401
01:16:27,542 --> 01:16:28,375
Very good.

1402
01:16:28,875 --> 01:16:33,917
I've seen that the government was paying out
a 140 000 pounds for this painting.

1403
01:16:33,958 --> 01:16:35,500
That for me became about numbers.

1404
01:16:35,525 --> 01:16:37,885
If you put all that money
into a bank account

1405
01:16:37,960 --> 01:16:39,725
earning 10 percent interest

1406
01:16:39,833 --> 01:16:44,417
you could pay for 3500 TV licenses a year,

1407
01:16:44,458 --> 01:16:46,208
and reconnect with all of them people.

1408
01:16:54,958 --> 01:16:56,958
No further questions, My Lord.

1409
01:17:14,917 --> 01:17:17,167
You saw the painting on the ITV news

1410
01:17:17,167 --> 01:17:20,625
and realizing it was worth 140 000 pounds

1411
01:17:20,625 --> 01:17:23,375
you decided
to come down to London to steal it

1412
01:17:23,375 --> 01:17:25,417
for personal gain, didn't you?

1413
01:17:25,667 --> 01:17:27,708
I thought I'd kidnap it for a while, aye.

1414
01:17:29,583 --> 01:17:32,833
Where did you stay
whilst you planned the heist?

1415
01:17:33,250 --> 01:17:35,208
I took digs near a bucket shop.

1416
01:17:35,917 --> 01:17:37,042
What's a bucket shop?

1417
01:17:37,458 --> 01:17:38,708
A shop that sells buckets.

1418
01:17:40,750 --> 01:17:41,958
Was that deliberate?

1419
01:17:42,250 --> 01:17:43,875
No, but it came in useful.

1420
01:17:43,958 --> 01:17:44,833
In what way?

1421
01:17:44,958 --> 01:17:47,667
This isn't my city, is it?
I don't know my way around.

1422
01:17:47,708 --> 01:17:50,750
So I'd get to Camden and ask a local,
"do you know where I can buy a bucket?"

1423
01:17:50,750 --> 01:17:52,458
And that way you'd get direction?

1424
01:17:52,458 --> 01:17:54,208
Everyone knows where you can buy a bucket.

1425
01:17:56,042 --> 01:17:58,208
Do you know the address of the shop?

1426
01:17:59,125 --> 01:18:00,417
Why? Do you need a bucket?

1427
01:18:03,958 --> 01:18:05,666
No, we need... Excuse me.

1428
01:18:05,821 --> 01:18:08,357
We need the address because you said
that you removed the frame

1429
01:18:08,457 --> 01:18:10,703
and hid it under the bed in your lodgings.

1430
01:18:10,875 --> 01:18:12,792
So is the bucket shop still there?

1431
01:18:12,833 --> 01:18:14,625
I have no idea. I've not been back.

1432
01:18:14,625 --> 01:18:16,208
I'm not short of buckets myself.

1433
01:18:16,667 --> 01:18:18,792
Mr. Bunton, you are on trial.

1434
01:18:19,292 --> 01:18:21,250
This is not an audition for a music hall.

1435
01:18:21,500 --> 01:18:22,333
Sorry, My Lord.

1436
01:18:29,542 --> 01:18:30,667
What am I looking at?

1437
01:18:31,042 --> 01:18:31,875
Ten years?

1438
01:18:33,649 --> 01:18:37,542
I'll make my closing speech and then
the judge will give his summing up.

1439
01:18:37,750 --> 01:18:42,333
Which I warn you may sound a bit like
the second speech for the prosecution.

1440
01:18:43,417 --> 01:18:46,417
All the benches up there
have this Latin phrase on them,

1441
01:18:46,713 --> 01:18:48,667
<i>Domine, dirige nos.</i>

1442
01:18:49,333 --> 01:18:50,500
Lord, direct us.

1443
01:18:51,125 --> 01:18:52,708
"God, help us" more like.

1444
01:18:55,917 --> 01:18:57,750
Well, I'll give you two some time.

1445
01:18:58,042 --> 01:18:58,875
Please.

1446
01:19:09,625 --> 01:19:11,125
Well, you are all over the papers.

1447
01:19:11,500 --> 01:19:12,333
Am I?

1448
01:19:14,958 --> 01:19:16,083
You could've told me.

1449
01:19:16,875 --> 01:19:18,500
We could've dealt with it together.

1450
01:19:20,333 --> 01:19:21,125
Could we?

1451
01:19:27,500 --> 01:19:28,875
I read the rest of your play.

1452
01:19:29,750 --> 01:19:31,792
I'm sorry you felt
you're to blame. You're not.

1453
01:19:38,500 --> 01:19:39,625
I went to see her.

1454
01:19:42,417 --> 01:19:44,833
-Nice spot, isn't it?
-Lovely.

1455
01:19:48,333 --> 01:19:49,458
Cleaned it up a bit.

1456
01:19:49,750 --> 01:19:50,958
I like the wildness.

1457
01:19:52,375 --> 01:19:53,583
She died in the country.

1458
01:19:53,750 --> 01:19:55,500
Any excuse to do nothing.

1459
01:20:01,750 --> 01:20:02,875
How long will you get?

1460
01:20:03,458 --> 01:20:04,292
I don't know.

1461
01:20:05,792 --> 01:20:06,792
Ten years?

1462
01:20:11,958 --> 01:20:13,417
You didn't take the painting.

1463
01:20:15,083 --> 01:20:16,958
Would you rather Jackie was in the dock?

1464
01:20:20,500 --> 01:20:21,917
I'm sorry, Dolly.

1465
01:20:24,750 --> 01:20:25,625
It's a mess.

1466
01:20:30,875 --> 01:20:32,125
It's a mess alright.

1467
01:20:42,792 --> 01:20:44,167
As the night follows day

1468
01:20:44,500 --> 01:20:46,208
Kempton Bunton stole the Goya.

1469
01:20:48,333 --> 01:20:49,958
So say the prosecution.

1470
01:20:50,542 --> 01:20:51,042
No.

1471
01:20:53,292 --> 01:20:54,500
That puzzled me.

1472
01:20:55,625 --> 01:20:57,758
Because nothing

1473
01:20:57,857 --> 01:21:03,042
is a crime in this country
unless it is expressly forbidden

1474
01:21:03,458 --> 01:21:04,292
by law.

1475
01:21:05,042 --> 01:21:06,500
If you neighbor

1476
01:21:06,750 --> 01:21:10,042
borrows your lawn mower
and doesn't return it for a month.

1477
01:21:10,125 --> 01:21:12,820
It is frustrating. It is annoying.

1478
01:21:12,927 --> 01:21:14,958
But it is not theft.

1479
01:21:16,583 --> 01:21:21,292
Because he had no intention
of permanently depriving you of it.

1480
01:21:22,708 --> 01:21:23,625
Kempton Bunton

1481
01:21:24,458 --> 01:21:25,458
is your neighbor.

1482
01:21:25,875 --> 01:21:26,917
He is not

1483
01:21:27,375 --> 01:21:28,208
a thief.

1484
01:21:28,750 --> 01:21:30,333
He borrowed your Goya to...

1485
01:21:32,167 --> 01:21:35,583
try and do a bit of good in this world.

1486
01:21:36,208 --> 01:21:37,333
It a world where

1487
01:21:39,542 --> 01:21:40,375
I 'm you,

1488
01:21:42,625 --> 01:21:43,625
you are me.

1489
01:21:44,667 --> 01:21:46,125
To try and benefit

1490
01:21:46,500 --> 01:21:49,375
some of the most vulnerable people
in society.

1491
01:21:49,417 --> 01:21:53,278
He returned it. Delivered it in person.

1492
01:21:53,393 --> 01:21:56,042
The Goya late? Yes.

1493
01:21:56,625 --> 01:21:57,458
Yes.

1494
01:21:59,458 --> 01:22:00,292
Yes.

1495
01:22:04,250 --> 01:22:07,375
Who amongst us hasn't been late
returning a lawn mower.

1496
01:22:11,417 --> 01:22:12,958
When all of this said and done,

1497
01:22:17,875 --> 01:22:19,542
he's a pretty good neighbor really.

1498
01:22:21,250 --> 01:22:22,083
Isn't he?

1499
01:22:25,500 --> 01:22:26,292
Thank you.

1500
01:22:36,958 --> 01:22:42,125
And in response to Mr. Bunton's confession,
that he took the Goya,

1501
01:22:42,458 --> 01:22:45,125
you may consider it
as a result of his defense

1502
01:22:45,208 --> 01:22:48,667
every gallery in the country
would be powerless to prevent anyone from

1503
01:22:49,250 --> 01:22:51,208
borrowing the Rubens for the weekend.

1504
01:22:51,364 --> 01:22:54,042
To hang it on the hallway
to impress the chair of the Rotary Club.

1505
01:22:54,417 --> 01:22:56,276
Can this country really allow

1506
01:22:56,300 --> 01:22:59,708
such behaviour to be placed
outside our criminal law?

1507
01:23:00,083 --> 01:23:03,583
Now that is the question
I urge you to focus on now

1508
01:23:04,167 --> 01:23:07,125
as you retire to consider your verdicts.

1509
01:23:22,069 --> 01:23:23,583
This is a good sandwich.

1510
01:23:24,958 --> 01:23:25,792
It is.

1511
01:23:26,500 --> 01:23:27,500
I felt cheese.

1512
01:24:00,125 --> 01:24:01,625
Will the foreman please stand.

1513
01:24:02,750 --> 01:24:04,375
And the defendant.

1514
01:24:05,333 --> 01:24:06,917
Ladies and gentlemen of the jury,

1515
01:24:06,917 --> 01:24:10,417
have you reached a verdict
upon which all twelve of you are agreed?

1516
01:24:11,500 --> 01:24:12,333
We have.

1517
01:24:13,250 --> 01:24:15,575
On the charge
of the theft of a picture frame

1518
01:24:15,598 --> 01:24:18,906
to the value of 80 pounds,
property of the National Gallery.

1519
01:24:19,292 --> 01:24:22,156
Do you find the defendant
guilty or not guilty?

1520
01:24:22,271 --> 01:24:23,156
Guilty.

1521
01:24:26,571 --> 01:24:28,176
Establishment fix up!

1522
01:24:28,305 --> 01:24:31,417
- <i>Establishment fix up!</i>
- There will be silence.

1523
01:24:32,458 --> 01:24:35,125
or I shall order
the public gallery cleared?

1524
01:24:37,083 --> 01:24:41,208
On the charge of a theft of the Goya
portrait of the Duke of Wellington

1525
01:24:41,375 --> 01:24:44,708
do you find the defendant
guilty or not guilty?

1526
01:24:55,875 --> 01:24:56,917
Not guilty.

1527
01:25:11,708 --> 01:25:16,042
On the charge of demanding money
with menaces for the return of the portrait

1528
01:25:16,042 --> 01:25:18,831
do you find the defendant
guilty or not guilty?

1529
01:25:18,880 --> 01:25:20,178
Not guilty.

1530
01:25:22,826 --> 01:25:24,030
Silence!

1531
01:25:24,861 --> 01:25:26,095
Silence in court!

1532
01:25:28,083 --> 01:25:30,806
On the charge
of creating a public nuisance

1533
01:25:30,906 --> 01:25:34,111
by depriving members of the public
of the opportunity to view the portrait

1534
01:25:34,211 --> 01:25:36,266
-do you find the defendant--
-Not guilty.

1535
01:25:51,625 --> 01:25:52,622
Silence!

1536
01:25:53,500 --> 01:25:54,708
Silence in court!

1537
01:25:56,875 --> 01:25:59,708
I will have silence.

1538
01:26:00,625 --> 01:26:01,750
Silence in court!

1539
01:26:03,583 --> 01:26:04,917
Remove that woman.

1540
01:26:05,958 --> 01:26:07,917
I'm not going anywhere.

1541
01:26:19,191 --> 01:26:21,297
<i>Kempton Bunton served three months...</i>

1542
01:26:21,708 --> 01:26:23,196
<i>for the theft of the frame...</i>

1543
01:26:24,500 --> 01:26:26,571
<i>which was never found.</i>

1544
01:26:31,667 --> 01:26:32,500
Thank you.

1545
01:26:35,583 --> 01:26:38,958
H M PRISON DURHAM

1546
01:26:43,667 --> 01:26:44,917
Give us one of those bags.

1547
01:26:46,583 --> 01:26:48,708
-You're here?
-Of course I'm here.

1548
01:26:48,750 --> 01:26:50,042
Where else do you think I'd be?

1549
01:26:51,174 --> 01:26:54,333
I hadn't been wasting my time,
I've put up a couple of plays.

1550
01:26:55,665 --> 01:26:57,924
Shakespeare must be shivering in a hitch.

1551
01:26:58,250 --> 01:26:59,208
I suppose so.

1552
01:27:00,333 --> 01:27:01,375
And Chekhov.

1553
01:27:02,542 --> 01:27:03,750
Who's Chekhov?

1554
01:27:05,383 --> 01:27:08,375
Do you remember that play
we went to see about the three sisters?

1555
01:27:35,375 --> 01:27:36,208
Here she is.

1556
01:27:45,375 --> 01:27:46,625
Welcome home, dad.

1557
01:27:48,042 --> 01:27:49,208
I'll put the kettle on.

1558
01:27:50,917 --> 01:27:52,542
Is one of those for me?

1559
01:27:54,958 --> 01:27:55,917
Wet your whistle.

1560
01:27:56,625 --> 01:27:58,375
-Cheers.
-Cheers.

1561
01:27:59,067 --> 01:28:01,246
Four years later,
keen to clear his conscience,

1562
01:28:01,346 --> 01:28:02,692
Jackie confessed to the theft.

1563
01:28:02,750 --> 01:28:05,388
-I needed that.
-I'm glad you did.

1564
01:28:07,583 --> 01:28:09,292
DIRECTOR OF PUBLIC PROSECUTIONS

1565
01:28:15,208 --> 01:28:19,125
The director of public prosecutions
and I have considered the evidence

1566
01:28:19,542 --> 01:28:20,417
in the case.

1567
01:28:21,583 --> 01:28:22,708
And your confession.

1568
01:28:24,750 --> 01:28:28,958
It goes without saying,
it is an offense of the utmost gravity.

1569
01:28:30,875 --> 01:28:31,708
However...

1570
01:28:32,708 --> 01:28:36,417
In order to prosecute
we would be compelled to call

1571
01:28:38,250 --> 01:28:39,667
the original defendant.

1572
01:28:39,833 --> 01:28:41,625
It puts us in a delicate position.

1573
01:28:42,542 --> 01:28:46,083
Given the public spectacle
your father seems to create.

1574
01:28:46,667 --> 01:28:49,083
So it has been decided

1575
01:28:51,125 --> 01:28:53,500
that prosecuting you
may not be in the public interest.

1576
01:28:53,625 --> 01:28:56,917
What? Do you mean Kempton
would make you look stupid again?

1577
01:28:58,292 --> 01:28:59,125
Sorry, I didn't mean.

1578
01:28:59,125 --> 01:29:02,542
Of course, if a single word of this
were ever to go beyond these walls

1579
01:29:03,125 --> 01:29:04,750
we could always change our minds.

1580
01:29:06,500 --> 01:29:08,500
-Clear?
-Clear.

1581
01:29:19,917 --> 01:29:21,542
-Irene...
-I will.

1582
01:29:21,542 --> 01:29:24,169
-Will you marry me?
-I just said, "I will."

1583
01:29:31,125 --> 01:29:32,958
<i>Just like you on this island, Dr. No.</i>

1584
01:29:32,958 --> 01:29:34,583
<i>It depends, Mr. Bond,</i>

1585
01:29:35,125 --> 01:29:36,833
<i>on which side of the glass you are.</i>

1586
01:29:38,375 --> 01:29:41,708
<i>A medium-dry martini, lemon peel.
Shaken, not stirred.</i>

1587
01:29:41,958 --> 01:29:43,375
<i>-Vodka?
-Of course.</i>

1588
01:29:54,458 --> 01:29:56,333
It's that bloody picture again.

1589
01:29:56,333 --> 01:29:58,375
You should put that into the wardrobe.

1590
01:29:58,667 --> 01:30:00,833
You'd have to get Jackie to fix it.

1591
01:30:10,758 --> 01:30:13,162
Free TV licenses
were eventually introduced in 2000

1592
01:30:13,723 --> 01:30:15,027
for the over 75s.

1593
01:30:18,375 --> 01:30:23,958
No play by Kempton Bunton
has ever been produced.
